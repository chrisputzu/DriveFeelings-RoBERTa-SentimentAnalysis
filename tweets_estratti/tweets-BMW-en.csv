So, to share my POV. The avg age of Web3 professional is 31 yrs, with a media. Salary of 100K. These young and highly affluent audience segment is a warm target who can be their future customers if not now and that’s how you seed the brand affinity in their mind and nurture."

It's a powerful compass.

When something is genuinely right for you, there's a deep, intuitive knowing that resonates within.

It's like a gentle whisper guiding you in the right direction.

Listen to that inner voice, for it's often wiser than logic or external opinions.

Your heart and intuition can lead you to choices that align with your true self and purpose.

So, when you feel that inner certainty, follow it. 

Embrace the path it illuminates, and you'll find yourself on a journey filled with authenticity and fulfillment."

Work like there is someone working 24 hours a day to take it all away from you.

This mindset isn't about living in fear but in relentless dedication.

It's about acknowledging that success demands unwavering effort and constant innovation.

When you work with that level of intensity and determination

You not only safeguard what you've built 

But also create opportunities that leave your competition trailing behind.

So, each day, give it your all!

A BMW X1 xDrive25e has 27bhp more, and can travel even further in fully electric mode, yet starts at £41,980. The Tonale has 276bhp and kicks off from £44,595."

Canada is ramping up more pressure to block U.K. from CPTPP unless food standards are lowered and hormone fed meat is accepted.

“If Canada lets the U.K. slip into the CPTPP with EU-like behaviours intact, it’s not just undermining Canada’s meat producers and exporters in terms of bilateral trade.

It’s letting the protectionist wolf inside the sheepfold of the world’s best shot at keeping rules-based free trade alive.

In the pursuit of your goals and dreams, maintaining motivation and drive is key.

Energize yourself with the passion and purpose that fuel your journey.

Strive for continuous improvement and growth, for it is in the process that success is born.

devoncnp,"When you’re poor or middle class it seems like no one is rich

Just the few people you know and the elites

I grew up in a small farm town

Rich was having an rv, a $500k house, a bmw and going skiing on the weekends

Now that I’ve lived in places full of wealth like Scottsdale Az and Newport California, wealth has a completely different definition

Everyone here is rich

Half the women have a $25k hand bag

Everyone here drives a luxury car

If I ever feel like money is running out in the world I just go outside and go for a drive. Ferraris, lambo, yachts, private jets are all you see

Your environment is everything. And when I had no money I understood this concept all too well. As soon as I had enough for a plane ticket to a city full of wealth I went there. I had never been more blown away by the quantity of wealth and just how many rich people there are

There are over 500k people in this world with a net worth of over $30 million

500k people!!!

You need to think bigger. You need to realize there’s more going on in this world than the small circle you’re in

As soon as you can travel to new places and see what wealth is actually like

Do it

You need to expand your mind in order to succeed in this world

There is way more wealth than you realize

You can join it if you’re determined"

hjwakerley,"It’s times like this that any control I have leaves my body and I do terrible maths to work out what I’d need to sell. 

The BMW e39 M5 is THE super-saloon, which is hard for me to say because I am horribly biased towards the Black Series. The M5 is grown up, whilst the Black is still very much a child. It wafts so so so so well but can show much newer cars a thing or two with the best part of 400hp in the form of a big ‘ole V8. 

Plus, just look at it, look at those wheels… my goodness. Those wheels are a thing of beauty. BMW of the 90s knows how to knock together a wheel. 

Anyway, my maths isn’t coming together so can someone who can add a few more miles to its measly 10,000 please buy it?"

Knauf (31,17 million)

As standard, the M2 boasts a 6-speed manual, taking it from 0-60mph in 3.9s, or you can opt for the 8-speed auto!

Grab yours today!!

ChristophLetsac,"I'm not sure what the criteria are for high-end cars, but Toyota 4Runners are not typically considered luxury cars or sports cars. As you included in your original post. Luxury car brands, especially in the 1990s, typically included names such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi, and Jaguar. I am sure there were others. 

Volkswagens from the 1960s also ran on 91 octane gas and were indeed considered affordable at the time. So, it's important to note that not all vehicles running on 91 octane gas can be classified as luxury cars or sports cars."

KONAN_BMW,"Chad betrayed the covenants and conventions signed with the Sudanese government, by digging a hole for his brother that fell into it. Chad destroyed its home with its own hands."
_hudsonc,"One aspect this does not explore is the deliberate choice Chad's President has made to allow UAE to use its territory and draw it into a war on the side of the RSF, despite a joint border security pact with SAF. He literally turned over his family home to a war effort, not just some agnostic site in the Sahara. The symbol of the Deby clan's power center.

Deby is an inexperienced, weak and impetuous leader who is barely holding on in #Chad, bullied by more powerful nations and constantly undermined by those around him.  He's so weak that he cant say no to Zaghawa generals openly training Masalit refugees to return to Sudan to fight the RSF and its allies (which is the coming civil war in Darfur), nor can he say no to arming the RSF on the opposite site.  He's now literally on both sides of the war in Sudan because he's too weak or greedy to prevent it and too unprincipled to take a stand.

And yet, Western leaders and the international community continue to invest in Chad, absolve it of its crimes against the opposition and the constitution, and praise it for its welcoming of refugees and its support to counterterrorism. But they are being suckered.  What's worse is that they are being played by man-child who is nothing more than a second-rate pawn in a much larger regional competition. What then does that make those Western officials and their policies toward Chad?

Its well past time that we stop looking at Chad as merely a refueling spot on the way to more important lands that surround it, but as the enabler of regional instability that it is quickly becoming, or better yet, as the next likely coup-striken country.  The implications of which will be bloody for Chad and devastating for a region already at war.

schahmehmud,"There’s no comparison: I've been a devoted Range Rover enthusiast since experiencing the 2nd and 4th generations. The 2nd generation BMW X7 M60i truly embodies an inspiring design philosophy also the luxury. However, when it comes to power, it's worth noting that Range Rover uses the BMW N63 engine in the P530, which can raise questions about the distinctiveness of driving a Land Rover with a BMW engine. Why pay more for the same power?"

leslibless,"CA Dem Senator Diane Feinstein died today, at 90 yrs old. 

She’s held this seat since 1992. Longest serving Dem Senator. 

Second to Nancy Pelosi, she is the wealthiest politician in Congress, w a net income of $220 Million. Her Senate salary is $210,000/annually.

She owns 6 exorbitant mansions, 1 yacht, and 12 luxury cars. 

For 20 years a Chinese spy worked for her as a driver, until he was exposed by the FBI. He infiltrated her Bay City office. 

She pushed hard for abortion up to birth, and wanted to take our guns. 

Yea, I don’t care… cause God will!"

NicklasNilsso14,"BMW extends CEO Oliver Zipse's contract until 2026, names new sales boss

Oliver Zipse will lead BMW Group until 2026, including the launch of the Neue Klasse EV platform. Jochen Goller, currently head of China, replaces Pieter Nota as head of sales.

BMW Group has extended the contract of CEO Oliver Zipse until 2026, and has named Jochen Goller, currently head of China, to the Board of Management, responsible for customer, brands and sales, replacing Pieter Nota.
Zipse, 59, has been chairman of the Supervisory Board and CEO since August 2019. Significant achievements under his watch include the introduction of a range of electric vehicles, including the iX and i4; taking the premium sales crown from Mercedes-Benz in 2021; and development of the Neue Klasse EV platform, which will start production in 2025.

His contract would normally have ended at age 60, in 2024, but the board has suspended that requirement and extended his contract by two years, Automobile News Europe sister publication Automobilwoche said.
Zipse, a native of Heidelberg, Germany, has a degree in mechanical engineering from Technical University of Darmstadt. He joined BMW in 1991 as a trainee, then held management positions in engineering and production, in Munich, South Africa and the U.K.
In 2012 he was named senior vice president, corporate planning and product strategy, and in 2015 became a member of the Board of Management for production. 

Goller, 56, has been with BMW since 1999, working in the U.K. and China in management positions, including as head of marketing in China from 2004-09, and then as head of the Mini brand in the U.K. and globally. He was named head of BMW’s joint venture with Brilliance in China in 2015, and head of the overall China region in March 2018.
China is BMW’s largest individual market, with nearly 800,000 sales in 2022.

“With Jochen Goller, we are appointing an internationally experienced sales manager to the Board of Management and a proven China expert who knows the BMW Group's largest market like no other,” Norbert Reithofer, chairman of the Supervisory Board, said in a statement Thursday.

Nota, 59, will step down on Oct. 31. The native of Wageningen, the Netherlands, holds a degree in business administration from Erasmus University in Rotterdam. He started his career at Unilever and worked there until 2005, when he moved to Beiersdorf, and then Philips in 2010. At Philips, he was named a member of the Board of Management in 2011.
In 2018 Nota joined BMW as board member in charge of sales and the BMW brand, as well as group after sales; in 2019 his responsibilities were expanded to include group sales, including Mini and Rolls-Royce. He was also named non-executive chairman at Rolls-Royce.
BMW achieved record sales of 2.5 million in 2019 under Nota, and the automaker said that it was on pace to equal or exceed this mark in 2023."

JonMisterek,"@614clinton 

From  2011   

A cowboy named Bud was overseeing his herd in a remote mountainous pasture in Montana when suddenly a brand-new BMW advanced toward him out of a cloud of dust.  The driver, a young man in a Brioni suit, Gucci shoes, RayBan sunglasses and YSL tie, leaned out the window and asked the cowboy, ""If I tell you exactly how many cows and calves you have in your herd, Will you give me a calf?""
Bud looks at the man, obviously a yuppie, then looks at his peacefully grazing herd and calmly answers, ""Sure, Why not?""
The yuppie parks his car, whips out his Dell notebook computer, connects it to his Cingular RAZR V3 cell phone, and surfs to a NASA page on the Internet, where he calls up a GPS satellite to get an exact fix on his location which he then feeds to another NASA satellite that scans the area in an ultra-high-resolution photo.
The young man then opens the digital photo in Adobe Photoshop and exports it to an image processing facility in Hamburg, Germany .
Within seconds, he receives an email on his Palm Pilot that the image has been processed and the data stored. He then accesses an MS-SQL database through an ODBC connected Excel spreadsheet with email on his Blackberry and, after a few minutes, receives a response.
Finally, he prints out a full-color, 150-page report on his hi-tech, miniaturized HP LaserJet printer, turns to the cowboy and says, ""You have exactly 1,586 cows and calves.""
""That's right. Well, I guess you can take one of my calves,"" says Bud.
He watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on with amusement as the young man stuffs it into the trunk of his car.
Then Bud says to the young man, ""Hey, if I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my calf?""
The young man thinks about it for a second and then says, ""Okay, why not?""

""You're a Politician from Washington"", says Bud.
""Wow! That's correct,"" says the yuppie, ""but how did you guess that?""

""No guessing required."" answered the cowboy. ""You showed up here even though nobody called you; you want to get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked. You used millions of dollars worth of equipment bought with my tax dollars trying to show me how much smarter than me you are; and you don't know a thing about how working people make a living - or about cows, for that matter. This is a herd of sheep. .....

Now give me back my fucking dog."

philroberts,"Model 3 1830kg
BMW 330e 1815-1905kg
BMW i4 2065-2290kg

Granted the brakes on the i4 are way better than the 3 but 3 isn’t that heavy in comparison to competitors 

I won’t argue the planet point here as that’s a whole separate thread but suffice to say you can recycle the battery into a new battery and you can’t do that with diesel / petrol.

I don’t think the point that EV’s are argued for by those with vested interests is valid, yes you could argue that I have a vested interest but as someone who was a massive car nut and has had a fairly long list of performance cars I’m a convert, they’re just much easier to live with and cost way less / breakdown way less

If you’re picking a car at the moment I do believe you need to be careful about what you select (Tesla is way easier to live with) mainly due to charge infrastructure but in general they’ve just thought through the whole owner experience and made it easy

If the 3 had better brakes it would be just about the best car I’ve owned. The Subaru did take a lot of beating though"

In times were all H2 stations are closing its good to know that you have plenty of range.

BMW iX5 Hydrogen is a fuel-cell all-electric vehicle that BMW and Toyota collaborated on. Despite the ""promising combination"" of German design and Japanese dependability, the vehicle’s performance has raised some concerns.

The iX5 Hydrogen was tested in New York, revealing a real-world range of just 94 miles (151 kilometers) on half a tank. When filled to the brim with hydrogen, the vehicle could achieve around 190 miles (306 kilometers) of range.

akarpf_netpress,"Oh, absolutely! It's truly commendable how Mercedes and BMW are making such groundbreaking progress in autonomous driving. I mean, who needs a comprehensive solution that can be used anywhere when you can have a system that only works on the highway under massive restrictions? It's not like people want to travel in cities, villages, or anywhere other than the highway, right?

But hey, let's not worry about that. Let's focus on celebrating these amazing achievements that are completely irrelevant in terms of autonomous driving. Who cares about misleading marketing and the fact that the technology they're using is not fit for purpose? As long as we ignore all the shortcomings and limitations, we can all pretend they're light years ahead of @Tesla.

Keep up the great work, Mercedes and BMW! Your highway-only solutions are truly groundbreaking. The world eagerly awaits the day when we can all exclusively travel on highways and never venture into those pesky cities or villages."

TeslaBest,"Remember how BMW's CEO said that Hydrogen will be the next hip thing ? 🤭

Well, Kyle from Out of Spec Reviews took the BMW iX5 Hydrogen car for a test drive in New York. And By the looks of it, it won't be very good 😱 

A short New York drive revealed that the iX5 Hydrogen has a real-world range of just 94 miles (151 kilometres) on half a tank. So Filled ""to the brim,"" you could get around 190 miles (306 kilometres) of range on a full tank 😳

And with the lag of infrastructure, and Hydrogen stations even being pulled down because they are financially unsustainable, makes range anxiety in a Hydrogen car reach peak highs.

BMW you should abandoned this sinking ship before it pulled you down 😵

- Green Hills Software is in the ADAS space, he has a conflict of interest and it would be bad for his software if Tesla is successful --> https://t.co/smqTaJw6QO

- Green Hills Software has also been in the news related to deaths and their links to an ADAS system --> https://t.co/hWKUhwf4zy

- NHTSA is already actively involved, and monitors and tracks Tesla's progress update-to-update to meet certain safety requirements before release. If something needs refinement they issue a ""recall"" by over-the-air software update for Tesla to address or enhance --> https://t.co/GQONuMpa65

- Tesla's FSD Beta is a Level 2 Driver Assist system (the driver is in control, the same level as Adaptive Cruise Control in any other vehicle) --> https://t.co/TbK5Nd4nMM

- His ""tests"" to discredit Tesla's FSD has used defeat devices (weights on the wheel, among other things) to make the vehicle do things not as intended when being controlled as instructed with driver monitoring - ignoring and dismissing all the warnings and disclaimers for proper use

- NHTSA has to date ignored Dan's desperate attempts at smearing FSD because it is statistically safer than a human without it (again, NHTSA sees this data as well) --> https://t.co/igR6E1Q8SW

Dan tends to:

- Ignore valid points related to conflict of interest, claims he makes no software
- Ignore that Tesla FSD Beta is Level 2 software
- Ignore Safety Statistics that Tesla provides NHTSA
- Ignores when people mention he uses defeat devices"

In times were all H2 stations are closing its good to know that you have plenty of range.

BMW iX5 Hydrogen is a fuel-cell all-electric vehicle that BMW and Toyota collaborated on. Despite the ""promising combination"" of German design and Japanese dependability, the vehicle’s performance has raised some concerns.

The iX5 Hydrogen was tested in New York, revealing a real-world range of just 94 miles (151 kilometers) on half a tank. When filled to the brim with hydrogen, the vehicle could achieve around 190 miles (306 kilometers) of range.

deutschebo40013,"The best conservative business for the future is the purchase of electric cars from German companies
 Electric cars:
 Volkswagen
 Mercedes Benz
 BMW
 Audi
 Opel
 They are emission-free and meet standard 7
 We are in the European Union and therefore I recommend buying a car direct"
MarkyIre,"@sendboyle A zero emission VW iD4 is approx 1900kg. 

A BMW M4 450bhp saloon is approx 1700kg. 

By this measure the BMW with is petrol fuelled engine would pay less than the zero emissions ID4. Is this what you’re advocating for?"

VolumePrintcess,BMW has told North American market motorcycle dealers to stop selling all models of its gas-powered (ICE) motorcycles while they investigate an issue with the machines that appears to involve emissions equipment. BMW says models currently in service are safe to ride and has not asked current owners of BMW motorcycles to stop riding their bikes or said that the problem presents a danger to riders.

pablo9948967714,"Jay Leno tests Raglan’s Tesla-powered Land Rover Defender $TSLA

Raglan
Raglan is a company formed by veterans whose mission today is converting classic Land Rovers to run on batteries.

One of its conversions, based on an original Defender, was featured on the latest episode of “Jay Leno’s Garage,” with company founder Joe Comiskey on hand to present it to Jay Leno.

Raglan’s conversions feature a mix of proprietary and Tesla technology for the running gear. A single motor is taken from old Teslas and paired with Raglan’s own gearset and inverter to suit the Defender which retains a mechanical four-wheel-drive system. The result is a peak output of 600 hp, or enough for 0-60 mph acceleration in about five seconds, according to the company.

Raglan’s settings for throttle response have been purposely set to deliver a more linear feel matching the original driving experience, which Comiskey said his team spent a lot of time developing. The vehicle also has various driving modes, including the ability to switch on or off regenerative braking.

The battery is an 85-kwh unit that Raglan estimates will deliver between 150 and 200 miles on a charge. To maintain the weight balance of the original vehicle, 75% of the battery is located under the hood and the remainder placed in the vehicle’s mid-section. Support for DC fast charging is included, in which case a full charge will require around 90 minutes.

Raglan is based in Wilmington, North Carolina, and each of its vehicles takes roughly 2,000 hours to build. There’s a lot of work involved as Raglan’s work doesn’t start and finish at the powertrain. The company also restores the rest of the vehicle, with only about 60% of the original parts typically being retained.

Buyers have a number of personalization options, too. In the case of the vehicle sampled by Leno, there’s a convertible top, plus Connolly leather trim, which Comiskey points out is the same leather used in early Land Rovers. Modern audio, climate, and infotainment systems can also be fitted.

Please like and Repost 👍

The others just can’t.
PLUS this increase in manufacturing costs will affect the ICE cars much more than the EV for how they are built (much more time and much more hand work).

AleAgoPiaggio,"I know I’d better 🤐🤷‍♂️🤐 and I may be very wrong, but this is my different take for the quarter:

• Tesla China built 84K cars in August, 64K in July, 76K in June: that’s roughly a 75K average in the former three months.

• They likely built up a decent inventory before shutting down the Model3 line to shift to the Highland, and the M3 sold about half of the Y.

• SO, September’s deliveries (not production, as the Highland inventory has been building up for weeks) could be short of ~25K  (1/3 of 75K) on August’s 84K. Which COULD mean Tesla may deliver 25K less vehicles than Q2…

• Assuming there was no efficiency improvement (was 10% from Q1 to Q2) and that the inventory has been wiped out, it would mean about 455K cars, which is exactly  the WS number.

Will they be right, FOR ONCE ?

It is a point that we need good ways for potential buyers of used EVs to have a way to verify the health status of the battery before they buy.

Also as more EVs get on the road we are seeing more 3rd party services who can work on EV batteries and sometimes change out a couple of bad modules in the battery and give you an almost new battery for much less than what the OEMs charge for a battery replacement."

mrjoebert,"TLDR; Don't park an EV that's been exposed to flooding in your garage until it's been thoroughly checked out.

I like Tesla, but giving people a false sense of security here is irresponsible.

The honest answer is, you have to be cautious with it until you can get a good look at the extent of the damage.

An insulated battery doesn't mean flood water won't short something that causes an abnormally high current draw from the batteries. I'm not sure how extensive Teslas over current protection is, but if floodwater is able to get into that protection circuitry it's useless and even completely insulted batteries can experience thermal runaway and burst into flames.

We got to see what can happen to an electric vehicle after a flood here in FL recently. I was able to see the plume of smoke resulting from this fire from a few miles away.

tesla_jokes,"You simply have not tried these products from a position where they'd help you.

And you'll probably have some remake to make about my life and how I made all this up or something but here it is anyway. We should all take serious comments onboard, reflect and maybe consider we are not 100% correct about things sometimes... 

Starlink has enabled me to get internet at home whereby it would have otherwise been too slow to work from home. WFH has improved my life 5x.

I bought a Tesla during Covid. It allowed me to go out on trips, kept me sane and I now visit more places I would never have otherwise visited since it so fun to drive, safe and AutoPilot make it so easy. I see my ageing, ill father and old friends, family more than ever due to this car. Before it was hard and tiring to go visit people so often. The Tesla is so easy to drive, there are no excuses now.

The car saved me from a least one accident, gives me confidence on long trips and costs me £6 to drive to the other end of the country.

Those who criticise, should do so from an educated place. 

If you don't like Musk, that's cool but if you're going to unfairly critisise his products, talk to people whom they have changed their lives or try them yourself. 

But Elon said this and that..
He is looking into the future, making educated guesses. Sometimes he is wrong, sometimes right but somehow he and his amazing teams get there in the end. 

Try making something that hasn't been done before and getting harassed on every interview on timelines etc. Eventually you will give in and give some kind of estimate, only to be wrong. It's a lose-lose. Yet people such as him keep going even though they could have bought an island, retired and given up years ago.

I hope this makes at least one person out there re-evaluate The effectiveness of Musk's products in some way. The ones I have are amazing, I never thought I would ever experience a car which can drive itself about on the highway and have fast internet in my own home via space lasers! - we don't all need this stuff but those that benefit, get real value for money, ask them."

EV’s battery are replaceable (see image)

Average person does not keep a car more than 5 years or 100k miles anyway. Having a 15-20 yr old ICE might be smart financially, but risky with obsolete technology and not enough safety features."

rovercrc,"When BlackRock's ETF money flows into #Bitcoin, it's poised to push its value over $100,000 within the first 2 years.

Here's why:

Some think a Bitcoin ETF won't change much because you can already buy it.

The ETF structure offers tax benefits and the ability to borrow against it. This makes Bitcoin ETFs particularly appealing to large funds, including pension funds.

Consider pension funds as an example: they currently manage assets worth $35 trillion. With the availability of a Bitcoin SPOT ETF, they now have an accessible gateway to invest, potentially injecting a considerable amount of money into the market.

I was/am annoyed w/AA for not giving evolution more credit for genius (Einstein, Tesla et al). On the other hand, the uncountable possibilities for deviation in our genetic programming would seem to expect a greater number of geniuses by now - even if they needed to stand on the shoulders of previous geniuses for their contributions to technology. Still we've been taught that evolution can take millennia. Maybe genius is not a feature, but a fluke...a dust speck on the mirror of evolution.  At least AA haven't asked me for money yet."

""When wireless is perfectly applied, the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain, which in fact it is, all things being particles of a real and rhythmic whole. We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of distance. Not only this, but through television and telephony, we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands of miles; and the instruments through which we shall be able to do this will be amazingly simple compared with our present telephone.

DavidPa71557488,"Nikola Tesla only practiced Zen every day and slept for only 3 hours. When he was over 80 years old, there were almost no wrinkles on his face.
It is easy to understand the aging speed of a person's body >>a person =  a machine need to be maintained every day,

An average of 8 hours of sleep is maintenance time. First, the digestive system, which converts food into nutrients, is needed to maintained first. And after dream, then time for the brain maintained, only needed 1~2 hours deep sleep (if not=all kind of brain diseases). And at last = skin are only arranged for last sleeping time maintenance before wake. Therefore, the speed of a person's body aging, just look at face, or whether he is sick, depends on his face and tongue.

Lions need to sleep and rest for half a day, while horses only need to stand and nap for a few hours, because lions need to digest meat and maintain their brains because they are thinking about how to hunt when they are awake. Horses eat grass and after wake up without using their brain minds to hunt, and only need just a few hours of sleep. I don’t know if anyone has seen an old and many wrinkled horse."

The manufacturer shipped 105,108 vehicles in the third quarter, up 296.3 per cent from the same period last year.

Tesla, which will release its September figures later this month, in August delivered 64,694 vehicles from its gigafactory in Shanghai, up 87.5 per cent year on year and 105.9 per cent from July, according to the China Passenger Car Association."

CaseykinNC,"Yes all EVs are so expensive. Is that the reason the Tesla modelY is the best selling car in the world? 

While in the past when EVs had poor battery management systems battery degradation might have been an issue that isn’t the case with the newer EVs with good battery management. Heck the warranty in the US is a min of 8 years and 120k miles and unless the battery has a manufacturing defect no batteries are getting replaced under this type of warranty for regular degradation.

There is only one component of batteries that involve child labor and that is cobalt. About 20% of the cobalt in one country involves child labor. Many cars are now using LFP batteries that no longer use cobalt. I guess you don’t know, or choose to ignore, that cobalt is used in the oil refining process, used in your cell phone battery and used as an alloy in high strength steel like the kind used in jet plane engines. Have you expressed your concerns about the use of child labor in mining cobalt for these uses?"

He named his son X Æ A-XII, which is pronounced ""#X Ash A Twelve."" Some people think it's a code for a new #Tesla model, while others think it's just Musk being Musk.

He once tweeted that he was going to buy #Twitter, then a few hours later said he was just joking. But then he actually bought Twitter.

He's a big fan of anime, and even made a cameo appearance in an episode of Rick and Morty.

He once said that he wants to colonize Mars, but he also said that he's not sure if he wants to go himself.

He's known for his work ethic, and has been reported to work up to 100 hours a week. But he's also known for his eccentric personality and his tendency to make controversial statements."

AleAgoPiaggio,"Tesla China built 84K cars in August, 64K in July, 76K in June: that’s roughly a 75K average in the former three months.

They likely built up a decent inventory before shutting down the Model3 line to shift to the Highland, and the M3 sold about half of the Y.
SO, September’s deliveries (not production, as the Highland inventory has been building up for weeks) could be short of ~25K  (1/3 of 75K) on August’s 84K. Which COULD mean Tesla could delivery 25K less vehicles in Q3 compared to Q2…

Assuming there was no efficiency improvement (was 10% from Q1 to Q2) and that the inventory has been wiped out, it COULD mean about 455K cars, which is exactly  the WS number.

DarkSageInvests,Early Tesla X to today
FutureJurvetson,"From X to X: Tesla’s Transition
I have been smitten with Tesla for 15 years now and have purchased the safest car ever made for everyone in my family and firm. Over the years, it has been clear how the cars have improved vertically, from one model to the next. But now that I have donated my early cars to an automotive museum, I am driving the latest Model X, and can compare horizontally, from my white Model X on stage with @ElonMusk for the first deliveries, to the Plaid X today.

The new X is amazing compared to where it started, with many fit and finish improvements, silent chassis rigidity, insane acceleration, longer range, drivetrain tuning, heat pump, and a more elegant interior design with no clunky AC vents. And it’s much less expensive. A number of controls and sensors have been removed (forward radar, ultrasound, and side-radar for door clearance detection). The steering wheel column is smooth with no stalks. Once the UI is streamlined, it seems obvious in retrospect. For example, the cameras and drive history can tell if I want to go forward or reverse.  It guesses correctly 100% of the time.  And this is just one subset of the full AI driving stack in development.  So many features that are standalone modules in legacy cars are just derivatives of the FSD stack, like auto high-beam adjustment, proximity alerts, and auto windshield wipers.  All of this is seen by the cameras.

And removing the stalks is an example of Elon’s mantra: “the best part is no part. It weighs nothing. Costs nothing. Can't go wrong.”

I am reminded of a passage I wrote for the Steve Jobs obituary in BusinessWeek: “Jobs was the master architect of Apple design. Often criticized for bouts of micromanagement and aesthetic activism, Steve’s spartan sensibilities accelerated the transition from hardware to software. By dematerializing the user interface well ahead of what others thought possible, Apple was able to shift the clutter of buttons and hardware to the flexible and much more lucrative domain of software and services. The physical thing was minimized to a mere vessel for code.

Again, this came naturally to Jobs, as it is how he lived his life, from sparse furnishings at home, to sartorial simplicity, to his war on buttons, from the mouse to the keyboard to the phone. Jobs felt a visceral agitation from the visual noise of imperfection.” — archived here: https://t.co/uZOcl0HX0Q"

InspiredTesla,"THEORY: Where did the seed of the idea Optimus come from?  Speculating here but I think It came from those early discussions that @elonmusk had with his robotaxi/Gen3 team where they were trying to figure out how it would work in all circumstances.  How does an autonomous Tesla enter a parking garage when it needs to take a ticket?  What happens when the passenger doesn’t close the door when they get out?  How does the robotaxi charge itself when there is no human there to plug it in?  

WELL, just as Full Autonomy needs to be achieved through learning from human drivers so too does the world the car interacts with, hence why Optimus was originally created.  You can’t have absolute autonomy without the robot to assist!

Now, Optimus will have many other functions, factory worker, assistant at home, first beings on Mars, but I feel the idea germinated from the need to have robotaxis be capable of full functionality inside and outside the car.

A Tesla for example  isn't more costly to repair if you're in an accident , unless you damage the batteries, in which case it's a write off. Insurance rates are a scam. And how are you  costing things for 2031 using 2023 data?"

MissSpookyMoo,"Is the classic Philadelphia Experiment tale really a cover for a more mysterious project designed by Nikola Tesla? 

Beckwith Electric CEO Bob Beckwith claims to have been a participant in the Philadelphia Experiment as a GE engineer working on field-coils for what he claims is the real test-platform: a smaller vessel named the USS Martha's Vineyard with naval designation ""IX-97"".

This overview states that the Philadelphia Experiment as reported by Moore & Berlitz may have actually been a cover story for a project developed by Dr. Edward Teller and Nikola Tesla. 

This well-written book provides a great deal of historical data relevant to support Beckwith's statements. And it's worth a read to just for the background on Tesla alone.

Beckwith writes about far more than just Tesla, though. In his story, the inventor is a key participant in a secret-experiment involving a naval minesweeper dubbed the ""IX-97"" which Beckwith himself claims to have worked on. 

Beckwith's story also contains photos; scans of historical documents and security clearances to document Beckwith's credentials; and details on the Allied development of early naval stealth technologies.

Is the Beckwith story true or just more naval folklore based on myth & legend? Decide for yourself after reading this well-written overview describing what he claims is the biggest breakthrough - and cover-up -- in History!

I've been following Tesla and other companies since 2008 looking for ways to fight climate change (age 23).

Tesla has been the most impactful by far.

I told myself around 2008 that I'd never buy a non-electric car. My first owned car was a Tesla, purchased in 2023. To be fair, I changed country about once every 1.5 years so a car was not needed until this year. 

I don't have friends that I go hang out with in the weekend. Don't need to virtue signal.
However, I do need transport that's as cheap and practical as possible.

With no other car than Model Y can I:
- drive almost free
- sleep in the car comfortably
- cook in the car when camping/traveling in the weekend or on vacation
- let the car drive on highway
- not produce unhealthy/harmful emissions when in use

It's very compelling for my use case."

In 2013, @Forbes  joined the skepticism, echoing sentiments of overvaluation.

The year 2014 saw @themotleyfool  Fool emphasizing Tesla’s stock as significantly overvalued through traditional financial measures.

2017 “I Think Tesla is Doomed” —  Robert Lutz Fmr. Vice Chair, GM Robert Lutz

The period between 2020 and 2022 was rife with allegations of a Tesla bubble, as critics continued to decry its overvaluation.

FoMaHun,"Today's provocative statement:

Lidar is dumb AF (for autonomous driving)

According to ""automotive experts,"" Tesla won't break into the self-driving market until they finally embrace Lidar. Unfortunately, these ""experts"" are unaware that Lidar is nothing more than a blind person's white cane. Driving blind is far from a wise choice. ""Experts"" need to understand, what does Lidar really do. Here you are:

Much the same as a blind individual navigating with a white cane👩‍🦯: it delicately explores the surfaces of the nearby objects.

But let's start with the fact that until 2012, Lidar wasn't a bad idea, as there was no evidence that computer vision could ever be feasible. And if it couldn't be done, why not drive blind, right? But...

It's been ten years now since 2012 when it was proven that artificial neural networks could not only make computer vision achievable but even superior to human vision. In 2012, the world witnessed the explosion of Deep Learning, the advent of AlexNet, and the acknowledgment that this was within the realm of possibility.

10 years have passed. Ten years!!!

Yet, many still cling to the idea of the white cane.

What, precisely, does Lidar, the technology of Light Detection and Ranging, accomplish? It emits (near infrared) light into a point in space and calculates the distance to that point based on the return delay. That's the extent of it.

Admittedly, this cane🧑‍🦯is thinner and extends farther than a blind person's cane, enabling it to map the subterranean depths beneath/through Amazon rainforest foliage and unveil ancient cities. Lidar has its role - elsewhere.

For when we contemplate the information a blind person can extract from their cane, we realize it is not only insufficient for autonomous driving but entirely redundant when a human driver possesses sight. 

Lidar is primarily employed to pinpoint an autonomous vehicle's precise location in a pre-mapped environment (unnecessary) and scan object surfaces (unnecessary). That's it.

Now, let's attempt to deduce which object is a traffic light from the information gathered with the white cane. Even this is nearly a mission impossible. And the color of the traffic light? A fully-fledged mission impossible.

In cases of road detours, Lidar ""sees"" the freshly painted yellow line as a surface protrusion of a mere 2 millimeters but cannot discern which line is actually yellow.

This is what Lidar offers - for a lot of money.

Let's say it aloud: it's impossible and irresponsible to drive without vision. 

That's why every Lidar autonomous system (Waymo, Cruise, etc.) also has a separate module responsible for vision. Yes, there is one. You need to detect the red light somehow, right?

However, you need a dedicated AI supercomputer to do this.

So they must have a dedicated AI supercomputer, you say. Yes, they do have one! But what occupies 100% of Waymo's trunk is so far away from Tesla's capabilities, it's not even apples or oranges. It's not worth comparing.

How do we know? Well, we don't know. We deduce this. ""Much of this is shrouded in trade secrets."" But if it reached Tesla's level, Waymo would be incredibly proud of itself and would advertise it. And if it did, it wouldn't need Lidar anymore, it would throw it away. But it doesn't throw it away, so... it drives semi-blindly! This is deduction at work 😁

Fact: the computational capacity necessary for vision is exclusively available in Tesla cars, and it has been there for at least 6-7 years in every single unit sold!

Now it is your choice to sit in an almost blind car or in a car that can see. What is your choice?

""When wireless is perfectly applied, the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain, which in fact it is, all things being particles of a real and rhythmic whole. We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of distance. Not only this, but through television and telephony, we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands of miles; and the instruments through which we shall be able to do this will be amazingly simple compared with our present telephone.

jaehwa,"테슬라 모델Y RWD 명절 장거리 운행 후기 2

9월 28일부터 어제(9월 30일)까지 2박 3일간 총 996km 운행했습니다. 오토파일럿을 통한 운전 스트레스 감소가 장거리 운행에서 상당한 장점을 가진다는 것은 지난 후기에서 얘기했으니 이번엔 전체적으로 느낀 점을 몇자 적어보겠습니다.

1
귀성길, 엄청 막혀서 가다서다를 반복하는 와중에 내비게이션이 최종 목적지인 부산 사이에 슈퍼차저를 계속해서 찾아주더라고요. 3군데 정도를 계속 바꿔가며 표시하는데, “대구이시아폴리스슈퍼차저”, “모다아울렛김천슈퍼차저”, “구미형곡슈퍼차저”… 정말 끝도없이 경로를 바꾸는겁니다. 은근히 이거 신경쓰이더라고요. 그냥 한군데로 정해주면 좋으련만… 그래서 아울렛 같은 곳이 낫지 않을까 하는 막연한 생각에 “모다아울렛김천슈퍼차저”를 목적지로 바꾸고 갔습니다. 여기는… 고속도로를 나와서 거의 20분 정도를 들어가야 하는 곳이었습니다. 지도상에서 좀 확인이라도 해볼걸… ㅎㅎ 그래도 덕분에 충전하는 그 짧은(?) 시간동안 딸내미는 나이키에서 옷 한벌을 득템(!)했네요. 내비게이션이 목적지 중간에 충전이 필요할 경우 슈퍼차저를 찾아주기는 하지만, 계속 바꾸기도 하는 탓에 그 중에서 한군데를 경유지로 추가해서 가는 것이 나을 것 같더라고요.

2
오토파일럿으로 운행 중에 도로의 제한 속도에 따른 최고 속도가 가끔씩 이상하게 변경되는 경우가 있습니다. 최고 속도 100으로 가다가 갑자기 60, 40 정도로 바뀌는… 그래서 순간적으로 속도가 확 줄어버리는 경우가 있더라고요. 아마도 IC로 빠지는 도로 혹은 지도상에서 겹쳐 지나가는 도로의 제한 속도를 잘못 잡아서 그런 것이 아닐까 하는 생각이 들었습니다. 약간 멍때리고 가다가 이렇게 속도가 갑자기 줄어버리니 같이 타고 가던 와이프의 “운전 좀 똑바로 해라”는 잔소리 공격이… ㅋㅋ 제한 속도가 변경되는 순간 순간에 액셀레이터를 살짝 밟아서 다시 속도를 올리곤 했는데, 돌발 상황이기도 해서 익숙지않아 울컥거리는 경험이 왕왕있었네요.

3
산소에 가느라 구리쪽으로 향했는데 가는 길에 정말 엄청난 폭우가 쏟아지더라고요. 오토파일럿은 정말 대단했습니다. 너무나 안정적으로 달리더라고요. 제가 운전했으면 상당히 신경쓰였을거 같았는데 말입니다.

4
오토파일럿이 너무 과감합니다. 빠른 속도에서 차간 간격을 7로 맞춰놔도 생각보다 앞차와의 거리가 가까웠어요. 게다가 그 앞차가 다른 차선으로 이동이라도 하면, 더 멀리 있는 앞차를 따라가기 위해 “망나니처럼” 튀어나갑니다. ㅋㅋ (물론 최고 속도까지 올리느라 그랬겠지요. 속도를 계속 조정해줘야하나 하는 생각도…) 가다서다를 반복하는 막히는 구간에서도 약간 급출발처럼 느껴지는 경우가 많았습니다. 차간 간격을 4-5-6-7 다 조정해봐도 비슷하더라고요. 잠들어있는 동승객(!)이 그때마다 깨서 한소리하네요. “운전 좀 똑바로 해라”

5
이게 팬텀브레이킹인가… 하는 순간들이 몇 번 있었습니다. 터널 안에서 갑자기 속도를 확 줄이는 경우가 있었고요, 고속도로에서 고가 도로 밑을 지나는데 도로의 그림자 때문인가? 싶을 정도로 그 위치에서 속도를 확 줄이더라고요. 정말 깜짝 놀랬습니다. 물론 그때마다 액셀레이터를 살짝 밟아서 다시 속도를 올려주긴 했지만, 이런 상황이 안오면 더 좋겠는데… 싶더라고요.

6
귀경길에 충전하러 “여주-신세계프리미엄아울렛 슈퍼차저”로 갔습니다. 전… 처음 가는 곳이었는데 와이프가 엄청 크고 인기가 좋은 곳이라더라고요. ㅋ 암튼 슈퍼차저를 찾느라 3바퀴는 뺑뺑 돌았습니다. ㅋㅋ 결국 물어보니, “구름다리 지나면서 초록색 선을 따라가세요”라는 말을 듣고 찾았습니다. 길치 인증… 충전하러 가는 길에 옆 인도에서 한분이 차쪽으로 뛰어오시더니 “저희 데차에 물려놓은거 이제 뺄텐데, 거기 쓰세요~”라고. 첨엔 이게 뭔말인가?!?! 하며 일단 감사하다고 말씀드렸다가 금세 상황파악하고 다시 말씀드렸습니다. “빨리 충전만 하고 가봐야해서요, 너무 감사합니다~”라고. 가족들이 “와~ 이게 테슬람들의 끈끈한 정이란 말인가”하며 놀라워했습니다. ㅋㅋㅋ 시간만 충분했다면, 데차에 물려놓고 쇼핑 제대로 할뻔 했습니다. ㅋㅋ 세상에… 나이키 매장 앞에서도 그 명품관에서만 서는 줄서는 모습을 보게 되었네요. 뉘신지 알수없지만, 그 분께 너무 감사드립니다. ^^
7
운행 시간이 길어졌습니다. 예전엔 장거리 운행 시 2시간 정도면 쉬어야 했었는데, 오토파일럿 쓰고 그러니까 그냥 계속 가게 되더라고요. 근데, 담번엔 중간에 일부러라도 쉬어야 할 것 같아요. 앉아있는게 너무 힘들더라고요. ㅋㅋ

생각해둔게 여러 개 있었는데, 막상 쓰려고 하니 생각이 안나네요. ㅋ 생각나면 댓글로 더 적어보겠습니다."

Ferdinand641,"It’s a gross oversimplification to single out Tesla’s hourly rate to workers as the reason why Tesla makes less expensive cars. 

The Unions are throttling the big three in a number of different ways, which push up costs and dramatically reduce efficiency. They’ll have far more workers than they need and they’ll have to buy in more to circumvent Union restrictions. 

As long as there are unions the big 3 are doomed. 

Tesla makes a car in 2.5 hrs and Ford 30. Tesla are far more efficient because they don’t have union obstacles. 

Unions completely destroyed Britain’s manufacturing industry and they’re causing havoc in the public sector now. 

Workers need to ask whether they might be better of working for the companies and not destructive unions. 

I understand the pickets are already using violence and intimidation and blaming the other side.

#Tesla #FSD"
RealDanODowd,"Nobody can replicate @WholeMarsBlog's zero-intervention Tesla Full Self-Driving drives. So we decided to investigate. It turns out Omar Qazi, the pathological liar, is lying to the public again, publishing cherry-picked propaganda videos, when he knows FSD will try to kill you.

Omar Qazi (@WholeMarsBlog), the leader of Elon Musk’s Full Self-Driving propaganda operation, constantly publishes tweets claiming that Full Self-Driving (FSD) is “really fucking good” and “arguably flawless”. Omar often makes announcements like “FSD BETA IS READY FOR ROBOTAXI!!!!!!!”, while publishing propaganda videos showing zero-intervention drives, where he never touches  the steering wheel or pedals as FSD drives him from place to place without any issues.

@WholeMarsBlog was identified by The Wall Street Journal as the Twitter account @elonmusk most often replies to. Omar always seems to be aware of internal @Tesla FSD news before the general public. He is among the first to get new releases. And somehow, like Elon Musk, FSD does not require him to ever touch the steering wheel, even though it appears he doesn’t use a wheel weight. Some, including NHTSA, have speculated he has access to the recently discovered “Elon Mode”.

What we want to know is how Omar achieves the long flawless drives in San Francisco that he frequently publishes, such as this video published September 25, 2023. Most commentators on his X posts note that when they try similar drives where they live they are unable to achieve zero-intervention drives.

Many people have speculated that since there are far more Teslas in California than anywhere else, FSD may be better trained to California roads and weather than elsewhere. But where we are located, in Santa Barbara, California, we get the same terrible results as everywhere else. So, FSD certainly isn’t optimized for all of California.

Maybe FSD is only optimized for Omar’s (and FSD’s) hometown, San Francisco. But we tried FSD in San Francisco and found that it performed just as poorly in San Francisco as it did in Santa Barbara. So San Francisco isn’t the answer.

Maybe Omar cherry-picked routes that he found FSD was particularly good at. So we decided to replicate Omar’s routes exactly like he did them. Same starting point, same destination, same route, same version of FSD (11.4.7). And it was awful. It tried to run a red light, it put pedestrians at risk before stopping in the middle of an intersection, and then, just after we finished Omar’s route and took the same road back, it ran a stop sign.

Never once did we manage to replicate one of Omar’s hallowed zero-intervention drives.

Once you have eliminated all that is impossible then whatever remains must be the truth.

The only conclusion we can come to is that Omar tries many runs of his cherry-picked routes until the traffic and weather conditions are just right, and he gets lucky, resulting in a zero-intervention drive. He then publishes this cherry-picked video of a zero-intervention drive, presenting it as proof that FSD is ready for full autonomy, when the truth is FSD is a pile of trash that Omar says “will at some point randomly try to kill you”. FSD makes driving much more stressful, even Omar complains about it. FSD drives like a drunk teenager, or as Omar describes it, FSD “is like having a moron with three brain cells drive your car”. And all the while, Omar publishes promotional videos claiming FSD is amazing.

We have repeatedly invited Omar and other FSD promoters to come to Santa Barbara to verify the results of our tests that show that FSD is terrible. Instead, they claim our tests are faked, then they refuse our invitation, because they know if they accepted, it would validate our claims.

We have offered to come to San Francisco and have Omar drive his car on his routes with multiple cameras recording. He has refused because he knows that his deception will be uncovered.

No one should believe anything that Omar, the pathological liar, says."

TSLA has disrupted the automotive industry forever, and once EV adoption gets to 60% or so, TSLA mathematically becomes the largest auto company in the world assuming it holds its EV share at ~20% as it grows out its franchise to pickups, <$30K segment, and autonomous driving.  GME and AMC were both in secular decline.  Many institutions own TSLA because it can deliver 25-30% CGR in both volume and eps for the foreseeable future, and looks cheap on DCF and PEG.  AMC and GME never looked cheap."

elektrotimmy,"Bad news for FSD Beta outside North America:

The GRVA has NOT voted on the draft as there is still too much to discuss. Therefore, the ADAS Taskforce is supposed to further develop the draft. 

The revised draft is set to be voted on at the next GRVA meeting at the end of January 2024. However, the draft must be completed and submitted by the end of October 2023 to comply with the given deadlines. To achieve this goal, two Taskforce meetings are planned: on October 5th and from October 23rd to 27th. 

Afterward, the draft must be discussed in the World Forum, with the next session scheduled for early March. Since the draft would be submitted very close to this date, it’s unlikely it will be discussed in March. This means the draft would have to wait until the World Forum session in June 2024, implying that valid regulation won't be possible until at least January 2025.

😞

I'm really frustrated with how slow our bureaucracy is moving on such an important issue. It’s crazy to have such deadlines and long waiting periods, especially in times of AI. The slow process delays crucial progress and can even put lives at risk. It's disappointing to see necessary advancements held back by red tape in a time that demands quick and decisive action."

alex_avoigt,"Authorities: 26  Operational Malfunctions in 🇩🇪 Giga Berlin are “Not a Scandal”

There have been 26 environmental incidents at the Tesla factory in Grünheide near Berlin since it opened in March 2022, according to the state environmental agency.

District press office of the community of 🇩🇪 Giga Berlin ""In none of the known incidents has there been any contamination of groundwater.""

In one case, soil had to be replaced when firefighting water seeped to prevent contamination, he said. ""In all other cases, technical and organizational protective measures prevented contamination of groundwater."" That's the way it's supposed to be, he said.

According to the environmental agency, the incidents were operational malfunctions, not incidents.

A release of substances into the environment is ""not a scandal,"" the district assessed. A safety system that assumes that all vehicles and containers at a factory or large construction site are 100 percent tight at all times and never leak would be ""highly negligent and downright naïve."" ""What would be worrying, on the other hand, is if there were irreversible groundwater impairment. This can be ruled out on the basis of the available monitoring reports.""

Stern has accused Tesla of polluting groundwater in a major media campaign and almost all other media are spreading these untruths in the German media which the authorities have now corrected.

Tesla had admitted that there had been several incidents on the factory site during construction and since commissioning. None of the incidents had been incidents according to the Federal Emission Control Act, and none had caused environmental damage.

It is probably no coincidence that massive FUD campaigns against Tesla are usually launched in Germany before Tesla's quarterly figures.

At the previous Q2 Earnings Call, @Tesla guided for a lower production in Q3 due to line shutdowns and ramping up the New Model 3 refresh, aka M3+. 

Even assuming the entire Q2 inventory being depleted, the ramp up to 500k in Q3 seems unlikely.

🔸Piper Sandler cuts Tesla estimates

""Tesla will soon release Q3 delivery data; in preparation for this, we are cutting our Q3 forecast from 515k+ to 445k units. This change is due entirely to downtime in Shanghai and Austin, where Tesla shuttered its plants in preparation for launching new products (the updated Model 3 and Cybertruck). Deliveries had been surprisingly strong up until recently, which is why it took us so long to cut our forecast, but the impact of shutdowns is now evident in weekly data. Arguably, intentional plant shutdowns should not be interpreted negatively, so if Q3 results are a ""miss"", we doubt TSLA will sell off."""

Why is Elon making the world think Tesla is more advanced when his FSD requires human intervention every 10 miles of driving compared to Waymo 10,000 miles?"
wooder32,"Tesla created the algorithm and passed through production hell.  They have built a worldwide fan base and supply chain with giant factories in China, Germany, and soon Mexico.  Their cost basis, cycle time, warranty reserve, and margins are the envy of the entire industry.  Their cost to repair is the lowest of any luxury brand. They have built a culture of relentless innovation and agile manufacturing with software and AI centric design.  They are hurtling towards a point where their production costs will be halved on the next generation model.  They have the potential to reap software like margins on FSD and disrupt labor itself with bot.  All this and you are worried that a man like Trump, a man who refuses to understand basically anything, is going to stop them?  Come on now… they’ve passed through the most difficult part in any company, which is scaling volume while keep quality sufficient and costs under control.  Their riding the gravy train now straight through to 2030 and beyond, it would take a meteor to stop them."

tryliarder,"**The British ""Tea"" Enigma: A Drink, A Dish, or Both?**

Amidst the land of ancient castles, Beatles tunes, and the occasional foggy day, there's a peculiarly British riddle that boggles many: the enigma of 'tea'. But let's spill the tea right away – this isn't just about a steaming cuppa!

Our tale unfolds around that sacred hour, 4 PM, Britain's unofficial ""stop-everything-and-have-tea"" moment. From the modern vibes of Manchester to the historical alleys of Bath, the nation seems to synchronise its watches to this time-honoured custom.

When you mention 'tea' to a Brit, be ready for some culinary action. Especially in places like North East England, 'tea' is so much more than Earl Grey in a cup. Places like Lancashire, Yorkshire, and the North East have long embraced 'tea' as dinner. Think hearty stews, pies, and all the comforting trimmings of a British evening meal. For our friend George from the North East, this isn't a quirky fact; it's just Tuesday. 

“Growing up in the North East,” George mused, “'tea' was synonymous with dinner. It's always amusing to see outsiders' eyebrows raise at the mere mention of a ‘tea-time roast’.”

Then there's the renowned 'Afternoon Tea'. Not merely a beverage, but an elegant affair of finger sandwiches, delicate pastries, and scones with their inseparable companions, clotted cream and jam. It's a mid-afternoon tradition that's as much about the spread as it is about catching up on the day's gossip.

And who could forget the 'Cream Tea'? A simpler affair dominant in places like Devon and Cornwall. But, simplicity doesn't mean without controversy. Oh no, there's a fierce debate: jam first or cream on the scone? A topic of heated discussion at many a British gathering.

In the end, the tradition of 'tea' in Britain is like a layered cake – each slice revealing a new flavour. And for George, every layer holds a cherished memory. “It’s not just a meal or a drink,” he says with a smile, “It's a bit of British soul in every sip and bite.” Cheers to that! 🍵🍽️"

Evidently, Politicians are in the pockets of fossil fuel, but they are still fighting a losing battle at the public's expense.

EVs are a no brainer for people and the environment.

SHANGHAI, Oct 1 (Reuters) - U.S. automaker Tesla (TSLA.O) on Sunday released an updated version of its Model Y in China, with minor changes to the vehicle's exterior and interior.

The changes include a new wheel design, according to a post by Tesla's official WeChat account. The starting price in China for the Model Y, the company's global best-seller, was unchanged at 263,900 yuan ($36,146).

Tesla unveiled a restyled Model 3 with a longer driving range, manufactured at its Shanghai factory, in China and other export markets in early September.

I wish someone would explain this to me as I don't know if this is true. Polish people were brainwashed during Russian occupation and this biased thinking may apply to the lot of my generation. And therefore the scars WW2 left on the mental side are huge. I came to understand all this, but there's a little hidden trigger inside my head that tells me to be careful when it comes to WW2 legacy, and how this really happened, and what is the truth behind it.

Beneath the soft glow of an autumn Sunday morning, the sun and moon share the sky's canvas in a rare, cosmic rendezvous. The sun, a radiant sphere, warms the world with its golden embrace, while the moon, a ghostly presence, dares to be visible in the azure expanse. It's a celestial ballet, a reminder of the magic that can grace a quiet day. Beside the riverbed, I find solace in this harmonious spectacle, where time seems to slow, and the world's worries drift away with the gentle current.

As I linger by the river's edge, the earthy scent of fallen leaves fills the air, and the trees display their autumnal finery in hues of amber, scarlet, and gold. The river's murmurs carry secrets of a thousand journeys, and with each ripple, nature weaves its tales. In the midst of this tranquil scene, I am immersed in the beauty of autumn, a season that awakens the senses and reminds us to savor the simple moments, like a Sunday morning by the river."

Tesla ในไทยก่อนหน้านี้ชาร์จฟรีอยู่ แล้วเพิ่งมาเก็บค่าชาร์จเมื่อวันที่ 28/9/23 ที่ผ่านมา โดยคิดค่าชาร์จหน่วยละ 10.10 บาทแล้วยังมี ""ค่าจอดแช่"" อีก 24 บาทต่อนาที (และอาจสูงได้ถึง 48 บาทต่อนาทีถ้าเต็มทุกหัว) โดยผู้ใช้ต้องผูกบัตรเครดิตไ้วอยู่แล้ว

ก่อนหน้านี้คนขับ Tesla จำนวนนึงเลยชอบมาจอดรถในช่องสำหรับชาร์จพวกนี้แล้วก็หายหัวไปเดินห้าง กั๊กช่องชาร์จไว้เยอะ บางคนก็เสียบทิ้งไว้เลยเพราะยังไงก็ชาร์จฟรีอยู่

พอมาตอนนี้มีค่าจอดแช่แล้ว พวกนี้ก็ชอบไม่เสียบสายกัน ซึ่งถ้าตู้ Supercharger Tesla เราสามารถ กดที่หัวชาร์จแล้วพอร์ทชาร์จของรถจะเปิดออกมาอัตโนมัติให้ทุกคนเสียบได้เลย

และแน่นอนครับว่าในกรุ๊ป Tesla เราก็คุยกันว่า เราจะทำแบบนี้กับรถที่มาจอดแต่ไม่ชาร์จกัน ก็เลยเกิดเหตุการณ์นี้เรียบร้อยขึ้นจริง

เจ้าของรถจะได้รับการแจ้งเตือนผ่านแอพอยู่แล้วว่ารถกำลังชาร์จ และกำลังจะโดนค่าปรับจอดแช่ครับดังนั้น ชาร์จเต็มแล้วไม่มาเอารถออกคือความชุ่ยของเจ้าของรถล้วนๆ ไม่มีข้อแก้ตัวอื่นๆ ได้เลย"

Which is kind of impressive since they have so wildly different view points. 

Ultimately it doesn't matter since Tesla will still dominate the auto market as the EV transition continues. 

Its just interesting that both sides of the political spectrum primary spokepersons are publicly against the most successful car company with the most domestic manufacturing. 

Why? Well there are lots of reason you could state but in the end it all boils down to Elon and Tesla do not pour enough money or favors into Washington to move the needle. 

Thankfully the big 3 auto companies are too mired in their existing structures and commitments to take advantage of their political upper hand. 

For retail investors, it means that whoever wins the next election don't expect much help from Washington, but also that shouldn't matter. So the political headwins are netural to Tesla's success."

pengster,Very good summary for everyone who is interested in FSD Beta from Tesla in Europe (or in my case Switzerland).
elektrotimmy,"Bad news for FSD Beta outside North America:

The GRVA has NOT voted on the draft as there is still too much to discuss. Therefore, the ADAS Taskforce is supposed to further develop the draft. 

The revised draft is set to be voted on at the next GRVA meeting at the end of January 2024. However, the draft must be completed and submitted by the end of October 2023 to comply with the given deadlines. To achieve this goal, two Taskforce meetings are planned: on October 5th and from October 23rd to 27th. 

Afterward, the draft must be discussed in the World Forum, with the next session scheduled for early March. Since the draft would be submitted very close to this date, it’s unlikely it will be discussed in March. This means the draft would have to wait until the World Forum session in June 2024, implying that valid regulation won't be possible until at least January 2025.

😞

I'm really frustrated with how slow our bureaucracy is moving on such an important issue. It’s crazy to have such deadlines and long waiting periods, especially in times of AI. The slow process delays crucial progress and can even put lives at risk. It's disappointing to see necessary advancements held back by red tape in a time that demands quick and decisive action."

The UAW strikes hitting the Detroit Three automakers — GM, Ford and Stellantis — could widen the electric vehicle gap between them and Tesla, which already controls 60 percent of the EV market.

The three Detroit automakers all use union labor, and those workers are represented by the United Auto Workers union — Tesla does not. If the Detroit Three meet all of the union’s demands, it could more than double the cost of paying a worker over the current amount. Already, industry insiders say labor costs at GM, Ford and Stellantis are considerably higher than they are at the electric car maker."

Tramp rant against electric vehicles and the transition to sustainable energy

*Batteries are very bad for the environment
*Windmills don't work
*EVs don't go far enough and are too expensive
*You can only drive for 15 minutes before you need a charge
*After 10 minutes you panic about charging
*Electric trucks have a fifth of the range of diesel trucks
*EVs are worse for the environment
*Electric trucks will destroy the supply chain
*Electric trucks don't have the power, they have only 300 miles of range. the battery takes all the room, no room left for the shipment 
*Electric boats will get you electrocuted
*The transition to electric vehicles is destroying your way of life
*We have oil for the next 500 years with zero effect on the environment"

valmsmith39a,"This is profound. Amazingly, there’s a complex function approximated by Tesla’s neural networks that accurately map a permutation of photon counts in a matrix (each frame of video) to acceleration (chg in vel / dir) values. It accounts for traffic lights, speed limit signs, stop signs, other vehicles, cyclists - basically everything. It’ll even know when to go a little over the speed limit if that’s what good drivers do in a particular situation. It’ll know when to slow down and keep driving though debris (vs a true obstruction to drivable space and something that occupancy networks had trouble with bc technically debris occupies space), and when to cross lane lines, if appropriate to the situation (driving around an accident). Musk could be correct that Tesla may have figured out an important piece of the AGI puzzle."

VisionaryVoid,"Nikola Tesla was a brilliant inventor and scientist who made many predictions that were ahead of his time. Here are some lesser-known facts about him:

Tesla was a vegetarian: Tesla was a lifelong vegetarian and believed that it was the key to his good health and longevity

Tesla had a photographic memory: Tesla had an incredible memory and was able to memorize entire books and images in great detail.

Tesla was obsessed with the number 3: Tesla had many quirks, one of which was his obsession with the number 3. He would often do things in sets of 3, such as walking around a building 3 times before entering.

Tesla was a germaphobe: Tesla had a strong aversion to germs and would often refuse to shake hands with people. He also hated pearls and human hair

Tesla's inventions were often ahead of their time:Many of Tesla's inventions were not fully appreciated during his lifetime, but have since become essential components of modern technology. For example, Tesla's work on alternating current (AC) laid the foundation for the modern power grid, and his invention of the Tesla coil is still used in radio technology today ."

His ability to foresee the potential of wireless communication and wireless power transmission, dating back to the early 20th century, is a testament to his remarkable genius.

Although some of Tesla's ideas were ahead of his time and not fully realized during his lifetime, they laid the groundwork for many of the wireless technologies we use today. His legacy as a pioneer in electrical engineering and wireless communication continues to inspire scientists, engineers, and innovators to push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of technology."

VisionaryVoid,"An interesting fact related to Nikola Tesla’s predictions about wireless communication is his development of the “Tesla Coil.” Tesla coils are electrical resonant transformers that produce high-voltage, low-current, and high-frequency alternating-current electricity. While Tesla’s work on these coils had various applications, one of the notable aspects is their use in early wireless transmission experiments.

Tesla believed that his coils could be employed for wireless power transmission, which could potentially provide electricity to remote locations without the need for extensive power lines. While he made some remarkable demonstrations of wireless power transfer in his time, this technology wasn’t fully realized during his lifetime.

Tesla’s innovative work on wireless power transmission laid the foundation for later developments in wireless communication, and his visionary ideas continue to influence modern technology today."

- Tesla's prediction was even earlier and centered on the concept of wireless communication, which was revolutionary in his time.

He foresaw a world where wireless technology would allow people to communicate and transmit audiovisual information seamlessly, regardless of geographic distances.

- His mention of television and telephony accurately foretold the development of television broadcasts and the ability to see and hear people in real-time over long distances.

These technologies have evolved into modern video conferencing and broadcasting systems.

- Tesla's emphasis on simplicity in these devices was insightful. Today's smartphones, tablets, and other portable communication devices are indeed incredibly user-friendly and accessible, fulfilling his vision of simplicity."

ShortdeckS,"Isn't it incredible how visionaries like Tesla could see the future so clearly, way before anyone else? I mean, this guy was talking about wireless communication and mobile devices back in 1926! That's not just smart; that's genius-level forecasting. And let me tell you, he was spot-on.

Then you've got this 1953 prediction, which is also impressive. Keep in mind, this was the era of rotary phones, folks. You were tied to the wall when you made a call. But even then, some people could see where technology was headed, and they were right!

It just goes to show, there are always forward-thinkers who can see beyond the status quo, who aren't afraid to predict big changes even when they seem impossible. These are the people who drive progress, who make America and the world a better place. It's truly astonishing to look back and see how accurate they were. Makes you wonder who's making the spot-on predictions today that we'll be marveling at decades from now."

The UAW strikes hitting the Detroit Three automakers — GM, Ford and Stellantis — could widen the electric vehicle gap between them and Tesla, which already controls 60 percent of the EV market.

The three Detroit automakers all use union labor, and those workers are represented by the United Auto Workers union — Tesla does not. If the Detroit Three meet all of the union’s demands, it could more than double the cost of paying a worker over the current amount. Already, industry insiders say labor costs at GM, Ford and Stellantis are considerably higher than they are at the electric car maker."

IamTheEmbalmer,"A little more on Nikola Tesla found online.

Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree, gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His AC induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.
Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wirelessly controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.

However, it should be noted that Nikola Tesla had made an earlier prediction back in 1926 that was also spot on:

""When wireless is perfectly applied, the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain, which in fact it is, all things being particles of a real and rhythmic whole. We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of distance. Not only this, but through television and telephony, we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands of miles; and the instruments through which we shall be able to do this will be amazingly simple compared with our present telephone. A man will be able to carry one in his vest pocket."""

Buy the relatively more expensive but also more thoroughly upgraded Model 3 or buy the more practical but unchanged Model Y.

mkruyt51,"The concept of autonomous robots, such as Tesla Optimus robots, sorting through garbage and making decisions aligns with the idea of using automation and artificial intelligence to address waste management challenges. Let's explore how this scenario might unfold:

Sensing and Perception:The Tesla Optimus robots would be equipped with advanced sensors, cameras, and perhaps even AI-powered vision systems to identify and classify different types of waste materials.
These sensors would enable the robots to perceive the composition of the garbage accurately.

Decision-Making:The robots would utilize machine learning algorithms to make decisions on how to handle each type of waste. This could involve sorting items for recycling, identifying hazardous materials, and determining the appropriate disposal method for non-recyclables.
Decision-making algorithms could evolve over time through continuous learning, improving the efficiency and accuracy of the sorting process.

Mechanical Manipulation:The robots would likely be equipped with robotic arms or other mechanical manipulators to physically handle the waste. This could involve picking up, sorting, and placing items in designated containers based on their classification.
Advanced grippers and manipulation tools would be designed to handle various shapes and sizes of objects.

Communication and Coordination:The robots could communicate with each other to optimize the overall waste management process. For example, if one robot identifies an item that requires special attention, it could signal other robots to assist or divert the item to a specific processing area.

Coordination would ensure that the entire system functions seamlessly and efficiently.

Integration with Existing Infrastructure:These robots would likely be designed to integrate with existing waste management infrastructure. This includes working with conveyor belts, sorting facilities, and transportation systems to ensure a smooth flow of materials through the entire waste management process.

Energy Efficiency and Sustainability:Given Tesla's focus on sustainability, the robots could be designed to operate using renewable energy sources or high-efficiency batteries, minimizing their environmental impact.

Data Analytics for Continuous Improvement:Data generated during the waste sorting process would be analyzed to identify patterns, optimize decision-making algorithms, and improve overall system efficiency.
Continuous feedback loops and updates would be implemented to keep the system adaptive to changes in waste composition and types.

The deployment of such autonomous robots in waste management could lead to increased efficiency, reduced human labor in hazardous environments, and better overall recycling rates, contributing to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly waste management system.

Tesla Optimus Robots: The possibilities are endless!"

The term ""Tesla"" is often associated with units of measurement, such as the Tesla (T), which measures magnetic field strength in the International System of Units (SI).

The use of Tesla's name in scientific terminology is a tribute to his significant contributions to the field of electrical engineering and electromagnetism."

I think this because we have seen Cybertucks being tested but no announcement of a release date. I don't think the testing would take this long if they found no issues hence the initial Q3 perdiction. 

In the end its not that big of a deal, just a few weeks delay but it does mean Q4 not Q3 release. I don't suspect the delay will be more then that."

It's as simple as that - they don't want Tesla to enter the European market because they won't sell any cars after that. Always keep in mind - Tesla is absolutely destroying the BEV Industry costing VW, Mercedes, BMW, Toyota, etc. millions of dollars. And there is no way back - their only way out is competing which they can't. That's why they want to delay Tesla as much as possible.

NeaX_TV,"Wow sorry to hear that you are THAT uninformed. Actually deep learning is based on that data. You need actual driving data - labeled and made useful for an AI to learn. There is almost no company that can effectively do that which has even nearly the amout of data as Tesla. And the Tesla AI Vision is far more advanced that any other on the market. 

Boston Dynamics is just a staged showoff with basically no way to mass-produce them. Looks good - but is basically useless for the masses. And robotics is not the same as Tesla Vision. That would be Tesla Optimus - which is indeed using Tesla Vision...

And ""only 1 car is affordable"" is more than zero. And in comparison to other cars they are way cheaper - not just in cost of the car itself - also regarding service and fuel. For example use the Model S Plaid and compare it to any other luxury sedan (doesn't even need to be fully electric). They are way cheaper than Mercedes or BMW for the same speed, range, tech, etc. And I haven't even started talking about the service, repair, fuel, etc.

Apple defined the way smartphones work today. Every new iPhone has the (basically) base price of the last iPhone which does not make it more and more expensive. There is no other smartphone chip able to compete with the newest Apple Silicon chips. And same thing will be the case with the Apple Vision Pro, the new MacBooks etc. And btw. gaining money is the most important part of an company in capitalism. If the producs were bad - there would be no money."

TESLA_winston,"After seeing @_bennettm_ and @Ethan_laigle1 ambient lighting setups I decided to purchase my own. I bought this LED light strip for $15. The quality is really good and the included tape adheres it very well. For $15 I cannot complain. 

There is 1 thing I do not like about it. It plugs into the USB drive which means it is constantly powered. This means I have to turn it off using the app or unplugging it. It doesn't bother me as it was $15. 😂

I am slightly tempted to buy a 12v to 5v converter with a USB alongside a foot well wiring pigtail so it shuts off, but for the moment it's fine. 

Here is how I installed it. 
First off, I did it the hard way because this kit is designed for cars with a glove box USB. I didn't want any wire showing.

1. I first installed the light strip centered on the dash.
2. I tucked the connector underneath the wood dash trim so it is out of sight entirely. 
3. I removed the center console. 
4. This might make some people mad but I don't really care. The car I installed it in is a June 2018 Model 3. On the early Model 3 they had 2 screws that sat inside at the front of the center console underneath the wireless chargers. However 4 months later they stopped putting screws there. My car had the screws so I took one out. I drilled the hole slightly bigger so I could fish the connector through to my USB port.
5. I then fished the wire through the dash and over the passenger kick panel.
6. Then I buttoned everything up. 

You can barley see the wires and I am very impressed with my work.

Fell in love…with a bird? Yes, really!

Tesla reportedly said:
“I loved that pigeon as a man loves a woman, and she loved me. As long as I had her, there was a purpose to my life.”

The brilliant inventor certainly had his quirks, like his fascination with the number ‘3,’ but this has to top the list.

“In 1922 Tesla reported that the white pigeon had flown into his room to tell him that she was dying. Before the bird passed, he said, a white light shone from her eyes, brighter than anything he had ever generated with his electrical machinery. Tesla was heartbroken at her death and told friends that at that moment, he felt his life’s work was finished.” (a)

First of all can ""being the apple of anything"" never be bad because Apple is one of the biggest companies in the world which defined the world of today. Further Tesla cars are way cheaper than most of the competitors especially regarding the same specs.

""ai vission can be anyone"" - there is not a single company out there with the same capabilities as Tesla FSD right now. They are years ahead of any competition. The collected data is the game changer in that field. No other company is able to collect that much real life data as Tesla does.

alojoh,"Hyundai launched last year under its Genesis brand the GV60 BEV. For model year 2024, the GV60 got a small bump in range. 

If you buy the GV60 over the Tesla Model Y Performance*, you pay +9% more for a car that has noticeably less range (-13%), is substantially slower (+54% 0-60mph time) while you have to give up a lot of cargo space (-28%).

A look at the GV60's other competitors confirms that a major shortcoming of the GV60 lies in its drivetrain: the GV60 proves it is with...
(1) acceleration of +0.7sec above market median of 4.7%** and 
(2) motors with -70hp vs market median of 382hp** simply underpowered relative to many vehicles it competes with directly!

Note:

watawatadayone,"🇯🇵The Sengoku period in Japan's history lasted from around 1467 to 1615, beginning at the end of the Muromachi period and continuing until the start of the Edo period. This period is considered to be very fascinating in Japan's history.
The Sengoku period was a time of intense battles and political maneuvering among various warlords and military commanders throughout the country. Even today, it is featured in a wide range of media, including movies, dramas, historical books, anime, and games. It is loved.

Episode⚔️
During the Sengoku period, Japan was ruled by shoguns, military commanders who had taken control of the government. However, the central government's power was weak, and regional lords, known as daimyo, had gained significant autonomy and power. 

The daimyo and their samurai armies fought against each other for land, power, and control.

One of the most famous battles during this period was the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. It was a decisive battle that led to the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate,which brought stability to Japan for the following 260 years.

The Sengoku period was also notable for the development of new warfare tactics, including the use of firearms, cavalry, and naval forces. The famous samurai warriors emerged during this time,and their code of conduct, known as bushido, became a central part of Japanese culture.
Despite the frequent wars, the Sengoku period was also a time of cultural flourishing, with art, literature, and religion evolving in unique ways. It was during this time that kabuki theater
tea ceremony, and ikebana (flower arrangement) all developed.

Overall, the Sengoku period was one of intense conflict and upheaval, but also one of cultural and societal development. Its impact on Japanese history is still felt today."

If we do not support Ukraine and help them defend their territorial sovereignity NOW then we will be forced to help all of Europe defend itself from further Russian aggression in the future.

We are also sending a CLEAR message to China that this is what happens if you try to invade your neighbors territory.

If you had any sense of World Diplomacy or even the slightest bit of historical knowledge, you would understand the subtleties of what President Biden is trying to accomplish in Ukraine...

Congratulations on voting for a entire regime that promised to phase out your management job. You are literally the worst person yet I think when it comes to problem solving and yet you type away. You have e conversations, but you clearly have nothing worth talking about and likely don’t like having conversations with people with higher expectations of themselves. Your logic is flawed, you may be a great person but you have to understand what you project as your attitude towards others is why you’re not taken seriously. You have the power to change things but I’m not convinced that you have the willpower.

The way you talk about firing people that don’t do what you want is horrible. That might be the job that feeds. But you’re on a power trip.

You are terrible at having a basic understanding about commentaries you started. If the public gauges your management skills off of your own words, you admitted to voting six times so you are either a criminal or a liar, which means that your management skills are something more like a bad hiring decision.

But it’s up to you to decide to take responsibility for your actions.

No shame in working at a gas station but why did you vote against your job?"

- Green Hills Software has also been in the news related to deaths and their links to an ADAS system --> https://t.co/hWKUhwf4zy

- Tesla's FSD Beta is a Level 2 Driver Assist system (the driver is in control, the same level as Adaptive Cruise Control in any other vehicle) --> https://t.co/TbK5Nd4nMM

- His ""tests"" to discredit Tesla's FSD has used defeat devices (weights on the wheel, among other things) to make the vehicle do things not as intended when being controlled as instructed with driver monitoring - ignoring and dismissing all the warnings and disclaimers for proper use

- NHTSA has to date ignored Dan's desperate attempts at smearing FSD because it is statistically safer than a human without it (again, NHTSA sees this data as well) --> https://t.co/igR6E1Q8SW

Dan tends to:

- Ignore valid points related to conflict of interest, claims he makes no software
- Ignore that Tesla FSD Beta is Level 2 software
- Ignore Safety Statistics that Tesla provides NHTSA
- Ignores when people mention he uses defeat devices"

OwnersTeslaThai,"🚀 TESLA: Driving Innovation Beyond EVs! 🌟

Tesla Inc. is on a remarkable journey, not just in the electric vehicle arena, but also in the world of cutting-edge robotics. 🤖🔋

🌐 Collaboration with Thailand: Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO, recently sat down with Thailand's Prime Minister, Prayuth Chan-o-cha, to explore the immense potential of the Thai electric vehicle sector. 

Thailand is gearing up to be a regional EV production hub, and Tesla is eager to be part of this electrifying evolution. 🇹🇭🇹🇭🙏🏻🙏🏻

🏭 Revolutionizing Manufacturing: Tesla is rewriting the rules of automobile manufacturing with its Gigapress.

Imagine assembling significant portions of a vehicle in a single piece!

This innovation promises to slash assembly time and costs, making EVs more affordable for all. 

3D printing and advanced alloys are also in the mix, underlining Tesla's commitment to pioneering production techniques. 🛠️🚗

🤖 Advancements in Robotics: Tesla's humanoid bot, Optimus, is embracing neural networks and cameras for navigation, sidestepping traditional LiDAR.

With precision and adaptability in its DNA, Optimus is set to redefine the world of robotics. 

Elon Musk himself hints at upgrades in actuators, sensors, and mechanics, with the first Optimus bot expected by November. 

Tesla is driving the future of robotics! 🤯🤖

Tesla is more than a car company; it's an innovation powerhouse that's shaping multiple industries.

What do you think about Tesla's foray into robotics? Are you excited about Optimus' debut? Share your thoughts! 👇🚀💡

You mean a virus that was blown so far out of proportion the govt went out of its way to violate people’s civil rights?

Then states like New York, California and Illinois are doing horrible.
Biden has his entire life in politics which shows why he’s a bad politician and morally corrupt. 

P.s if you want to use this logic then trump was the best president in my lifetime for the economy and for America. Because he gets a pass and remove everything once Covid happened. 🤷‍♂️

FoMaHun,"Today's provocative statement: 

Outside of Tesla, no automaker will ever be able to implement Over The Air (OTA) software updates properly.  No matter what the manufacturers say or promise. They simply don't know what they're talking about - but we've come to expect that from them.

But seriously, why can't they do it? Volkswagen, for example, has 6,000 programmers, right? Isn't it supposed to be that anything the human mind conceives can be programmed?

Maybe not. There have been some botched attempts by VW and perhaps Audi. Yet setting up an OTA infrastructure isn't really a difficult task. There are plenty of example codes on StackOverflow; you can piece it all together. Or ask ChatGPT to generate one for you! 😁

The problem is bigger than this. Even if they had the OTA infrastructure in place, they still wouldn't be able to install the downloaded software anywhere in the car, because the whole vehicle is nothing more than a pile of ... components bought from 3rd party suppliers and bolted together. It's not even a car; it's just a pile of .... parts 😅

Some estimates suggest that in such a ""car,"" there are hundreds of components with some kind of software, but these run embedded and are completely inaccessible from the outside. Some are even etched into ROM!!! There's no possibility for organized updates because there's not only no API but no data connection either.

What's an island is an island.

Remember the Tesla Model 3 brake problem that the manufacturer fixed remotely on all sold Model 3s within a week? That's what I'm talking about. That's depth. That's firmware. That's integration. That's something! Not to mention the fart feature! 🙂

Just think about the speed of this fleet wide repair, then think about the cost of NOT calling back a million or so cars into the delerships!

And this is that will never, ever be available with traditional automakers. Or at least not until they get all their suppliers on board with a common and open software platform.

So basically: never! 🙂

This small yellow arrow will slowly kill each and every other car markers one by one.

abetterfuture42,"Your spending your time trying to slow the progress of a lifesaving technology. 

Accept that FSD is BETA, and must be monitored by a human driver. 

Accept that the COMBINATION of a human driver monitoring a computer driver is saving lives right now. This is evidenced by the accidents per mile driven statistics provided by Tesla. 

Accept that, through a progressive incremental improvement phase, FSD will become as safe and reliable as a human driver. 

Then understand that this is just the beginning. The process of “chasing the nines” will develop FSD into driving software that will eventually outperform the best human drivers. 

Just understand where we are in that continuum and you will save yourself an impressive amount of time, and eventual embarrassment."

thedraftsman,"To be honest, this is quite silly. Tesla is using vision to create a real time map as an instance. Instead, each Tesla should contribute to a global map repository as it generates the new map. The next Tesla that drives by can download this map, and verify the accuracy, and push updates if needed. This ensures features that basically never move (stoplights) have a high degree of certainty in the map. Basically you’re creating 2 version of map memory- long term and short term. Global map and delta map. Less compute needed for that @elonmusk @Teslaconomics"
Tesla,"Tesla FSD doesn't rely on high definition maps, which means Autopilot can be enabled at locations the car has never seen before.

While it does take navigation into account to arrive at the correct destination, it will simply stay on the most likely path if no route or map is available.

This path is determined by what most people would have done in any given scenario—powered by learnings from our global fleet of millions of vehicles.

The concept of lanes is also only loosely built into our system, enabling the car to confidently drive on unmarked roads"

FoMaHun,"Today's provocative statement: 

Outside of Tesla, no automaker will ever be able to implement Over The Air (OTA) software updates properly.  No matter what the manufacturers say or promise. They simply don't know what they're talking about - but we've come to expect that from them.

But seriously, why can't they do it? Volkswagen, for example, has 6,000 programmers, right? Isn't it supposed to be that anything the human mind conceives can be programmed?

Maybe not. There have been some botched attempts by VW and perhaps Audi. Yet setting up an OTA infrastructure isn't really a difficult task. There are plenty of example codes on StackOverflow; you can piece it all together. Or ask ChatGPT to generate one for you! 😁

The problem is bigger than this. Even if they had the OTA infrastructure in place, they still wouldn't be able to install the downloaded software anywhere in the car, because the whole vehicle is nothing more than a pile of ... components bought from 3rd party suppliers and bolted together. It's not even a car; it's just a pile of .... parts 😅

Some estimates suggest that in such a ""car,"" there are hundreds of components with some kind of software, but these run embedded and are completely inaccessible from the outside. Some are even etched into ROM!!! There's no possibility for organized updates because there's not only no API but no data connection either.

What's an island is an island.

Remember the Tesla Model 3 brake problem that the manufacturer fixed remotely on all sold Model 3s within a week? That's what I'm talking about. That's depth. That's firmware. That's integration. That's something! Not to mention the fart feature! 🙂

Just think about the speed of this fleet wide repair, then think about the cost of NOT calling back a million or so cars into the delerships!

And this is that will never, ever be available with traditional automakers. Or at least not until they get all their suppliers on board with a common and open software platform.

So basically: never! 🙂

This small yellow arrow will slowly kill each and every other car markers one by one.

TSLA has disrupted the automotive industry forever, and once EV adoption gets to 60% or so, TSLA mathematically becomes the largest auto company in the world assuming it holds its EV share at ~20% as it grows out its franchise to pickups, <$30K segment, and autonomous driving.  GME and AMC were both in secular decline.  Many institutions own TSLA because it can deliver 25-30% CGR in both volume and eps for the foreseeable future, and looks cheap on DCF and PEG.

Alen_Tesla,One of the fairest assessments I’ve seen on boarder issue and immigration
krassenstein,"Whether you are a random person on X or Elon Musk, I urge you all to please read this post and stop using videos like this one to claim that Biden has an ""open border policy"":

#1) The people in this video are already on American soil.  The agents have a few options here.  Detain them behind the razor wire or detain them in front of it, let the children cut themselves on razor wire or make sure they don't get cut.  

#2) In May President Biden issued an ""asylum ban"" which barred migrants from applying for humanitarian protection if they cross the border against the law or fail to first apply for safe harbor while crossing through another country on the way to the U.S. The US COURTS OVERTURNED IT.  Biden also requested $3.5B for more border patrol agents and judges and lawyers.  Republicans refused.

#3) Let me explain to you all why the people in this video can't simply be put on a truck and driven back into Mexico and dropped off:  

a - They have a right to due process according to our Constitution.
b - There are international laws indicating that we can't just drop people off from Honduras or Cuba or any other nation into Mexico.  What if one of these people claimed they were from Canada?  Should we drop them in Canada?
c - How do we immediately prove that a person is not an American, or an Italian, or a Brazilian if they claim they are?  

Stop pretending that Biden isn't doing anything.  Stop pretending that the immigration problem is simple.  Stop pretending that this has not been a problem for decades.  

Understand that the surge of migrants isn't the fault of Biden but actually global geopolitical upheaval in Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela and other nations.  Instead of pointing fingers and claiming that ""Biden has an open border policy,"" when his policy is not much different than those we have had for the last 40 years, how about working together on comprehensive reform?

So before you make another Tweet claiming Biden has an Open Border Policy, how about instead you provide actual solutions that are LEGAL, that should be implemented."

NewEdgeFitness,"As we journey through life, one thing is certain: aging is inevitable. But let me tell you, it's not something to fear or dread. Instead, it's an opportunity to showcase the remarkable strength and resilience that resides within each of us.
Imagine a tree standing tall through the changing seasons, its branches stretching towards the sky. In the same way, our bodies have the capacity to adapt, grow, and remain strong regardless of the passing years. Just like a muscle that becomes stronger with exercise, our spirits can rise to the challenge of aging with grace and determination.
Fitness isn't about achieving an unrealistic standard of youthfulness; it's about embracing the vitality that comes with taking care of ourselves. Every workout, every stretch, every healthy choice is a testament to our commitment to a life well-lived. The sweat on our brows is a reminder that we're investing in our own well-being, ensuring that we're fit enough to chase after our dreams, no matter our age.
Remember, the passage of time doesn't weaken us; it refines us. It molds us into wiser, more experienced individuals who possess an unwavering inner strength. So, let's approach aging with enthusiasm, viewing each day as an opportunity to prove that age is just a number. Together, we can break the barriers of what society expects, and show that the best version of ourselves isn't constrained by time, but rather defined by our determination.
Stay strong, stay fit, and let your light shine brighter with every passing year! 💪🔥

Degs_EV,"Interesting FACTS about the recent Megapack battery fire in Queensland, Australia.

Some great points as to how Tesla can “be less wrong”

The Megapack comes in a shipping container, how hard would it be to seal the entire container from the roof down, ventilation fans in the roof, plumb in water pipes, set up water storage tanks on the site with high volume pumps.

If a fire is detected, shut of all power to isolate, then fill the container with water.

This won’t extinguish the fire but will contain it and reduce the temperature.

As the water gets hot, it can be gravity drained to cooling storage tanks on site, these could be recirculated once cooled to the same fire.

Once it is all over, the water can be transported by tanker trucks to a treatment plant.

There are more options and ideas to solve this issue, would love to know what others think.

skyline991gt3,@GPreac @AmyMek @elonmusk He gives himself massive pay packages of obscene levels and says he won't sell and his money will be the last out of a retail owned company tesla. He's just a shyster and he sells 0 from spacex where only his rich friends can invest. @elonmusk is a globalist

RFD8080,@GordonJohnson19 @NHTSAgov @SECGov @FTC This is a known problem with multi light edge cases (red and green lights seen) at the intersection.  This would confuse a human as well.  The problem Tesla has to solve is what does the car do when there is conflict in the scene.  IMO FSD sees all possibilities as equally safe.
swamiaravind,@MissJilianne B.S. He is not against @Tesla. He is against any govt regulations that unfairly push EVs &amp; cripple ICE industry. Let them all be available in the market &amp; let consumers decide what they want to buy. Let the market phase out ICE vehicles faster &amp; fairer than any govt regulations.
TheAppleCore,@egs2123 And why does it matter at all? Tesla took a ton of Saudi money. Our country uses an abundance of Saudi oil to operate the diesel trucks that deliver everything you own. It’s a global economy. Don’t be narrow minded. We do business with Germany. Do you remember WW2?

HONGLE28711028,"Im just a Tesla owner w FSD beta version, but I sure understand its my responsibility to monitor the car while using the feature. Anyone is solely responsible if wrongly used. Remember its L2 w beta function, you dont expect it to perform otherwise.
Its a waste of money, time and effort. Talking to other Tesla owners who careless about their own safety is meaningless imo."

mike48506837264,@RockwellVIPER @unusual_whales I bought my car from an American union brand and have had nothing but good experiences with it. I give Tesla credit to being early. They had a monopoly on it for years. Competition only really emerged in the last 2 years unless you were buying very high end cars.

SuperAwesBros,"When Elon’s AI Takes You Camping in 2050

---

Ah, the great outdoors, nothing but nature, the starlit sky, the gentle rustle of futuristic AI-driven tents setting themselves up, and of course, the sweet hum of a Tesla Camp-X Hot Tub™ bubbling away nearby.

As I approached my campsite, the marvel of modern technology unfolded before me. Every tent was a mini smart home, controlled by none other than Elon Musk’s Neuralink. The campsite was a loop of futuristic luxury amidst the rugged wilderness, an oasis of innovation.

Now, the days of struggling with tent poles are over. It’s all about asking Elon’s AI to pitch your tent while you sip a Dr. Pepper by the hot tub. And speaking of hot tubs, this wasn’t your average one. It was a Tesla creation, complete with an autopilot mode (for those turbulent water currents) and a SpaceX themed light show to enjoy under the stars.

As I eased into the warm, bubbling water, I couldn’t help but wonder: What’s the protocol for campfire songs in the digital age? Do we gather around a holographic fire and let our Neuralinks sync up to create a harmonized melody? The future of camping surely has its quirks.

And now, a question to ponder as you soak in the futuristic wilderness vibe: How do you think camping traditions will evolve with the infusion of Musk-tech?

Oh, and before I forget, here’s a joke to tickle your camping funny bone:

Why don't football teams ever go camping? 

Because they always get too tense (two tents) when it’s a close game!

---

Take a moment to soak in the humor, enjoy the imaginary Musk-inspired campsite, and let your mind wander into the techno-wilderness. Elon, you've outdone yourself once again!"

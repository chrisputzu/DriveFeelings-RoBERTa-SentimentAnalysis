MrBradleyFink,"This morning we arrived to Salta and rented a small Renault. It was still early when we drove up into the Andes Mountains, at first through some very green ranges, and then going north everything dried up and turned to a high, yellow, desert landscape, which continued all the way to San Salvador de Jujuy. From Jujuy we drove the Camino Inca as far as Humahuaca, where everything is desolate, and there we visited some adobe homes and walked through the ruins. It is a short, sun-scorched people who live in this part of the country. They have built little villages right up out of the sands. Many stop to watch us as we pass them on the road. From Humahuaca it was one narrow road leading south through the mountains, which sometime toward dusk descended to an end, and then we were driving alone through the wide open desert üèú. Aside from the llamas and the scrub and a few squat cacti there was nothing to be seen for miles. Once we talked of turning back, but then finally after sundown we arrived at a small, grotesque, indigenous village built up out of the nothingness. There is only one road that passes through the village, along which are some empty tiendas, and at one end is a door with painted letters that read HOSPEDAJE. Here we have taken a cement-block room with two mattresses and a lightbulb. It is late now, and I am writing by the light of the bulb. This is a strange, eerie place in the desert. The village is called San Antonio de los Cobres. Tomorrow we will wake-up early and continue south toward Cafayate."

the_zb_,"He‚Äôs been pretty outspoken about this exact situation in interviews recently.

He DID take a step back for a while. They were outclassed by the Mercedes Turbo Hybrid in 2014 and beyond, no doubt. When they approached Renault about upping the game on the engine side, the Renault CEO basically said ‚ÄúF1 is not a priority to us, you get what you get.‚Äù

Newey left that meeting disillusioned and angry, knowing there was almost nothing they could do until their PU was at least close to comparable to the competition.

He almost left RB, for that very reason. He felt trapped by the Renault mediocrity, no matter what he did on the chassis side.

But he stayed. He stepped back a bit, but he stayed. The rest, as they say, is history."

lutherk007,@NuTyrant Renault Project XY-2
the_zb_,"3 things are true here:

1. Renault knowingly, deliberately cheated at a Grand Prix in order to alter the race result in a way that makes the entire GP irreparably tainted and illogical to include in a championship

2. The infamous Massa pit stop happened directly because of this incident. Who knows if the hose gets ripped away in a subsequent stop, but that‚Äôs beside the point.

3. The World Drivers‚Äô Championship result was materially altered by this instance of cheating due to altering the race result, which was allegedly known about and hushed by both governing bodies, F1 and the FIA, until the season ended as a matter of convenience to not affect the season.

All 3 of those things are unjust and have no place. I believe the precedent should be set that in the instances of egregious collusion and malfeasance, tainted Grand Prix results should be removed from the results of the season standings. That changes the 2008 WDC, as we all know.

In the event of human error (as discussed ad nauseam from 2021), I completely get the sentiment that the race should never have ended as it did. That is correct. Lewis should‚Äôve been WDC. But a very real case can be made that the results should stand, for one major reason: officiating is always part of competition, good and bad. But if error was not made in bad faith (deliberate collusion or cheating), that is absolutely terrible but it also happens all the time in sports. Basically, to use football terms, a referee awarded a terrible penalty and there was no VAR‚Ä¶ so the penalty stands and changes the match, and everybody knows it‚Ä¶ but he wasn‚Äôt paid off and it was a genuine mistake of officiating, so the result stands. That‚Äôs a widely experienced precedent.

It‚Äôs just unfortunate happenstance than Lewis Hamilton would be negatively affected by both major instances, 2008 and 2021.

Lewis haters are all over this approach because it hurts his records. I am no Lewis hater, I just think this is the logical approach, and it unfortunately hurts Lewis in both instances. But that is not good enough reason to not do the correct thing, when thoughtfulness is given to each situation on its own merit."

LeeviMttnen,"@wearetherace @XPBImages @eddstrawF1 Mclaren would once again become a factory status team that they need, and Renault would still be able to market their technology. Renault has always been a better engine supplier to teams like Williams, Benetton or RB rather than being a manufacturer team on its own."
LeeviMttnen,@wearetherace @XPBImages @eddstrawF1 One solution could be that Renault sell the Enstonw team to someone like Andretti for huge money and invest some of that money to the Viry factory.

""My discussions in 2014 with Ferrari were purely out of frustration, I really didn‚Äôt want to leave but we were in this position where Renault hadn‚Äôt produced a competitive turbo hybrid engine. That happens in the first year, OK, new rules. We all make mistakes.""

""But we went to see Carlos Ghosn [former Renault CEO], Christian [Horner], Helmut [Marko] and myself to try to put pressure on him to up the budget. Ghosn‚Äôs reply was 'Well, I have no interest in Formula 1. I‚Äôm only in it because my marketing people say I should be.' That was such a depressing place to be.""

""And that was such a depressing place to be. We knew Mercedes wouldn‚Äôt give us an engine, Ferrari had a great engine, but we‚Äôd used Ferrari‚Äôs initially and I‚Äôd taken us away from Ferrari in the first year to Renault, because I believed, rightly or wrongly, that if you‚Äôre in a championship battle, Ferrari would never give us equal equipment.""

""So, we were stuck with Renault for some huge amount of time looking forward to the future. And so being in this position, where it looked like we couldn‚Äôt be properly competitive in any visible point in the future, was just a very dark tunnel to be in.""

ChakhoyanAndrew,"On the controversy with Yaroslav Hunka, I‚Äôm no historian & no matter what I say, someone will surely find it offensive.

But this is what I‚Äôve learned so far
‚ùìdid Hunka serve in the 14th Waffen-SS Grenadier Division ‚ÄúGalicia‚Äù?
‚ô¶Ô∏èyes

‚ùìwhat was he doing there?
‚ô¶Ô∏èfighting Soviets, who committed genocide in üá∫üá¶ just a decade ago, attempting to exterminate Ukrainians by starving millions to death #holodomor. Was he justified in wanting russians out of Ukraine? You tell me. 

‚ùìdid Hunka slaughter Poles & Jews, as many allege?

Tesla Gets Caught In EU-China Crossfire

As it cracks down on China-made electric vehicles, the EU isn‚Äôt just rounding up the usual suspects. The probe will ensnare big international names as well, including BMW, Renault, and EV superstar Tesla, which all export EVs from China. Elon Musk might need to break out some diplomatic skills soon

The EU‚Äôs antitrust investigation claims that China is artificially flooding the market with cheap EVs via enormous state subsidies. An EU official told the Financial Times on Tuesday that the probe applies to any company that exports EVs from China

Unmade In China
For Tesla in particular, its China operations are a crucial part of its logistics network. Tesla‚Äôs Shanghai plant is its largest by output, accounting for half of the company‚Äôs global deliveries in 2022. Per data provided to Bloomberg by Schmidt Automotive research, 47% of the vehicles Tesla sold in Europe during the first seven months of this year came from Shanghai

With some vigorous re-jigging Tesla could turn this into an opportunity. Unlike its China-based rivals, Tesla has a European plant, opening the Berlin Gigafactory in March 2022 after various delays. Though the factory is operating and helped Tesla overtake Volkswagen in European EV sales, it‚Äôs not fully ramped up yet:

‚Ä¢ Expansion plans submitted by the company in July show it wants to double vehicle production capacity at the Berlin factory to 1 million cars per year. It‚Äôs worth noting that the plant doesn‚Äôt currently produce the 500,000 cars it‚Äôs capable of making annually

‚Ä¢ The Berlin plant only makes the Model Y, so reconfiguring it to produce other models like the Model 3 would be a heck of a sprint. The Berlin Gigafactory has also struggled with understaffing issues, Wired reported in December

Tesla might have time on its side, however, as it‚Äôs uncertain how long the EU probe will take. ‚ÄúWe believe bark is worse than the bite here,‚Äù Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told The Daily Upside, adding: ‚Äúwe see a contained impact to Tesla from this latest EU issue with the can kicked down the road into 2024.‚Äù By then, Tesla might be building a whole new factory somewhere

Imitation is the Highest Form of‚Ä¶ Nevermind: Another automaker re-thinking its China tactics is Ford. Per a report from The Wall Street Journal, Ford attempted to mimic Tesla‚Äôs strategy of selling direct to consumers in China, but has found precious little success"

NicklasNilsso14,"Tesla, BMW, Renault exports from China are part of EU anti-subsidy probe
Tesla, Renault and BMW export EVs built in China to Europe.

Tesla and European automakers that export from China to the European Union will be part of the bloc's probe into whether the country's electric vehicles industry is receiving unfair subsidies, the Financial Times reported, citing Brussels' most senior trade official.
The European Commission has launched an investigation into whether to impose punitive tariffs to protect EU producers against cheaper Chinese EV imports that it says are benefiting from state subsidies.

EU executive vice president Valdis Dombrovskis said the probe is not limited to EVs from Chinese brands.
""It can be also other producers‚Äô vehicles if they are receiving production-side subsidies,‚Äù Dombrovskis told the Financial Times.
Tesla exports the Model 3 to Europe from its Shanghai plant, Renault exports the Dacia Spring EV to Europe from China, BMW exports its China-built iX3 EV to Europe and some Volvo models as well as Polestar models sold in Europe are built in China.

During the evidence-gathering that precipitated the EU's announcement this month of its anti-subsidy probe into Chinese EVs, Tesla was among the companies found to have likely benefited, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.
The aim of the EU's investigation will be to determine whether, and to what degree, China has subsidized Tesla and domestic manufacturers including BYD, SAIC Motor and Nio, and to take any necessary counter measures to level the playing field for the EU's industry, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations.

Tesla started exporting Model 3 sedans built at its Shanghai factory in late 2020, less than a year after starting production at its first car plant outside of the U.S. By July 2021, Tesla referred to the facility as its primary vehicle export hub.

Through the first seven months, Tesla sold an estimated 93,700 China-made vehicles across Western Europe, accounting for roughly 47 percent of its total deliveries, according to Schmidt Automotive Research. The next biggest exporter of EVs from China to Europe was SAIC's MG, with roughly 57,500 registrations."

Checo‚Äôs seat should be secure until the end of his contract, and then he should be replaced by either Tsunoda or Lawson after being allowed to finish his Red Bull stint with honor.

I dont think Tsunoda will ever be a championship level driver, which is what Red Bull needs as a #2 driver as long as Max is present.

Lawson is the better choice, but we all see what happens to championship drivers when they‚Äôre paired up with Max, so doing that to Lawson would be detrimental to his career."

Is this really worth causing a fan civil war?"
RenaultFan1,"My take on this dumb drama:

It was fair for Ocon to ask for the position to be re-handed back at the end if Pierre couldn't catch Alonso.

It was insanely wrong for Alpine not to tell Pierre this was the new plan.

evclinic,"Another Q210 Renault Kangoo ZE from 2014 with an interesting issue (I can't remember exactly) at around 200,000 km on the odometer where the safety pin of the gear linkage holding the differential gears on the driveshafts broke. The motor itself arrived with the description of the problem being ""it goes in reverse but not forward."" It didn't go forward because the pin had come out and damaged the gearbox housing. Just to touch on the topic of the damaged differential output transmission with the R240 rotor that we publicly sought someone to repair, and why we fixed this too. Facebook wondered why we didn't just buy a new rotor - well, Facebook, there are no new ones available. Let me introduce you to the fact that for any electric drive in the world, you can't buy individual components like gears, bearings, seals, synchromesh, etc. We have to either manufacture them ourselves or find suitable replacements that we modify, make spacers, and offset flanges. Thanks to the small entrepreneurs around us whom we introduce to the world of EVs by sending these EV components for repair when there are no replacement parts, we indirectly show them that it's not impossible. Kireta's machine shop made a new pin and assembled everything anew. Once again, this is a case of a Q210 drive, proving that changing the 1-liter of oil in the differential is crucial, at least every 150,000 km or every 7-8 years (no need to treat it like a diesel engine, changing every 10,000 km and every few months), to avoid this and similar problems. With the repair of bearings and gears and the replacement of seals, the electric motor is still powering the vehicle.

The Paris prosecutor's office has charged the former leader of the French National Rally party, former French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen - and 27 of her associates - with misuse of European Union (EU) funds, reports the French publication Le Monde

According to the prosecutor's office, Le Pen and other party members used the money allocated to pay for the work of assistants to members of the European Parliament to pay the employees of the National Rally.

If the case goes to court, Le Pen faces up to ten years in prison, as well as a fine of one million euros, writes the European press. In addition, she could be banned from holding public office for ten years.

In general, today is a sad day in the Kremlin - another of their dearly-bought pawns may potentially be pushed 'off the board'."

FuWaToRoKaRaAGe,"From the wise man's explanation. #French President Emmanuel Macron appears to be planning to introduce regulations on CO2 emissions associated with manufacturing and transportation, with the aim of giving #PSA, in which #Renault and #Stellantes participate, an advantage in car manufacturing and sales. It seems that the purpose of the regulation is to eliminate #BEV s made in China. The so-called French internal combustion engine car manufacturers are unable to compete with Chinese BEV's manufacturers. It seems that the plan is not to apply BEV subsidies due to regulations to Chinese manufacturers' BEVs. Vehicles manufactured by Chinese manufacturers are said to emit the highest amount of CO2 in the world during manufacturing and transportation. When eliminating Chinese manufacturers' vehicles, it is likely that Japanese manufacturers' vehicles will also adapt. This is because, after China, Japanese manufacturers emit the highest amount of CO2 during manufacturing and transportation.

In addition, the new models, for example the new Scenic ev has a poor specs and an high price.
These companies are not able to use FLP batteries and this is a mid/long term issue for them.

rcblue5,"I am going to go one claim by one in this it will be long but deal with it
1. Daniel left RB and was nothing so those years in Renault when he was taking a shit box to podiums was nothing got it. But you say he was nothing after he left so 2021 monza nothing got it and the next race where he had p4 and should of had a podium nothing oh and the fact he was in the points in more races then lando oh yea forgot he was nothing. Last year he was bad yes but so was that car in general that was made how lando likes it.
2. In spa he did have damage yes Pierre Hamlin Franz Tost both confirmed it he had a broken rear wing that made his DRS almost non existent which then killed his tires in a train he couldn‚Äôt get through. Yet still was laping within a tenth or quicker then Yuki every lap.
3. He was beating a max yes he was young but he also was beating Carlos sainz at this time was max and winning races was max at this point. and most years it wasn‚Äôt close between the 2 also can we not forget how he killed Seb the year after he had just won 4 titles in a row and his first year in a RB.
Your whole stuff is based off a few races of Liam yes Liam deserves a seat but so does Dani and from a marketing and team side Dani there makes more sense he would probably be doing same results as Liam next year. With a new title sponsor who is going to want a marketing chip."

the_zb_,"If it had been revealed at that time, at that race when the FIA and F1 knew about it, you‚Äôre probably right in that Renault would‚Äôve been disqualified and that‚Äôs probably all they would‚Äôve done.

However, that‚Äôs not what happened. And you make my argument for me. it isn‚Äôt an equitable ‚Äúsolution‚Äù for a retroactive correction because you‚Äôre exactly right - everything after that cheating incident was changed. Even the Singapore race result, as the pit stop incident was induced by the ‚Äúfake crash‚Äù.

The race result itself is tainted, and that can‚Äôt be solved for. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is to exclude it.

This exact same argument can be applied to Abu Dhabi 2021. But I grant you, there‚Äôs a much more clear ‚Äúthis is what should‚Äôve happened‚Äù in that circumstance, and therefore would be cleaner to ‚Äúadjust‚Äù a race result.

But that Logic just doesn‚Äôt work for the 2008 Singapore instance. It was cheating and (allegedly) collusion by the governing bodies to hide it until a more convenient time for them.

There is NO clean or neat way to resolve it, but that also doesn‚Äôt mean cheating that demonstrably altered a WDC result should stand. It‚Äôs my opinion that excluding the race in question is the only logical thing to do, if they do anything."

FormulaUR_,"Something else on my mind regarding this:
Ricciardo drove for 4 different teams before joining McLaren performed well in all of them. It‚Äôs clearly not the case that he can only be fast in a Red Bull. 
The Renault didn‚Äôt fully fit his style at the beginning when he joined, he had to change some things to gel with it and he got on top of it after a few races.

Not to be negative about Sainz here, but he gets called ‚Äúadaptable‚Äù when he struggled to drive the Renault and the Ferrari in 2022. 
If Sainz is adaptable, then Ricciardo is too.

Generally speaking, only about 3 or 4 drivers in recent history have actually shown incredible adaptability across a range of different car characteristics. The rest are all quite similar."
FormulaUR_,"This is quite incredible to read, and it‚Äôs the first time hearing this from Ricciardo himself.

It‚Äôs unheard of for a racing driver to ‚Äúpermanently‚Äù lose their fundamental technique, and the only way that can happen is if someone or a group of people are externally trying to re-mould it. A driver or an athlete alone will never lose their core muscle memory they‚Äôve developed over 20 years. 
F1 drivers and elite athletes in general are physical freaks of nature. If this problem is occurring, the team is likely more accountable than the athlete. 

The more I hear about it, the less I blame him for not gelling with the Mclaren. It was doomed from the very start.

Luckily McLaren have also learnt and are not putting Piastri through the same by letting him drive with more freedom and get on top of the car without having to enforce a specific way of driving."

ima51607,@ridhitshawarma @IshaanBhatta @RBR_Daily 2021 nd 2008 are nowhere near similar. 2021 was a human error that favored redbull. Thats a fact not an opinion. Whats also a fact is that despite renault cheating in singapore 2008. Massa ruined his season himself by making constant mistakes in key races like silverstone
Samrendra_mohan,@tonybtp20 @SkySportsF1 Felipe Massa started from pole position. Drivers' Championship leader Hamilton was second while reigning world champion Kimi qualified third. They continued in this order until Renault's Nelson Piquet Jr. deliberately crashed on lap 14.Bringing the safety car out.
Darkerthanyourd,@BGCFreed @TheNBAStan @fiagirly They are done when winners are actively involved in the scandal. In this case Hamilton is not the culprit. The jury is out on Renault and FIA.
Silency4shizz,@BigBadP @mhdazamali @FastestPitStop That 25s penalty wasn't even a penalty because they had to create a rule after that to stop it happening again. Also why void the race in Singapore 2008? They could just exclude  Renault from the results like the did McLaren in 2007 which was a much more serious offence.

Humpidumpi2,"Renault Kangoo ZE from 2012 with a capacity of 22 kWh. The actual usable energy capacity is about 15 kWh. The vehicle is not bidirectional and is charged with photovoltaic power during the day. Its usage is decreasing over time.

I'm considering deregistering the Kangoo, parking it in the garden, and connecting a power generator to the drive axle to provide electricity for the heat pump at night.

This is certainly not efficient, but probably cheaper than converting the Kangoo's batteries into a home storage system.

In Belgium, we receive very little compensation for feeding electricity back into the grid, even though we produce a lot of excess PV energy during the day that is not utilized at night.

Is the idea feasible or am I just daydreaming?"

BigRichardSmall,@EdMorrissey @DavidStrom Not really a Louis Renault Award since this lady did not see the consequences of her own actions. Frankly that‚Äôs even more frightening.
f1_editor,"But when Renault cheated, they didn't affect just their own performance, or their own race. They affected the whole race, all teams and drivers and the results as such are all tainted, which is why they can make a case to have the race results thrown out. They changed the entire order, flow and nature of the race when Piquet Jr. deliberately crashed. It wasn't like Benetton running with traction control in '94 where you can just exclude them since they never affected an entire race's order."

Hello and warm greetings,
I am Koichi Miura, a Japanese native.
I am not fluent in English, so I would greatly appreciate it if we could communicate in Japanese.

Drawing from my 24 years of experience in the gaming industry, I am currently spreading my wings as a YouTuber and a freelance 3DCG designer.
Today, I am reaching out with the desire to share an exciting new car presentation idea with you, the esteemed car manufacturers from around the globe.

I have attached a brief video summarizing the technical demo for you to peruse. I hope it sparks your interest!

This presentation has been crafted using a tool called UEFN (Unreal Editor for Fortnite), released just this March, to function as a tech demo on the gaming platform Fortnite.

It‚Äôs a dynamic showcase, operable on PC, PS5/4, XBOX, Nintendo Switch, and Android devices.
By experiencing it firsthand, I believe you will grasp the revolutionary potentials of this presentation method.
To indulge, please enter the following map number in Fortnite:
1007-6205-2396.

If this captures your curiosity, I would be thrilled to have the opportunity to discuss it further.
You can delve into my background and other details at the following website:
https://t.co/MhkYFjPDgR

I harbor a deep passion for automobiles.
I yearn to convey the joy, the beauty, and the myriad appeals of automobiles to people worldwide.
Together with esteemed automobile manufacturers like you, I am eager to foster new, exhilarating experiences.

I eagerly await the opportunity to connect with you.
Thank you for considering my proposal!

TheAfronomist,"Renault Sc√©nic E-Tech Officially Revealed: Square Elegance with Over 620 km Range

The Evolution of Sc√©nic: The Sc√©nic model made its debut 27 years ago. Its latest, the fifth generation, aims to appeal to families in the age of electric cars, focusing on spaciousness, comfort, cutting-edge technology, long range, fast charging, and more.

Renault's Move to Impress Modern Families
Electric vehicles now offer more than a decent alternative to combustion engine cars. It's no wonder they are gradually filling the lineups of both smaller and larger automakers. For Renault, this marks a significant step forward, as the French brand plans to sell only electric vehicles in Europe by 2030. The new Renault Sc√©nic E-Tech is the largest electric vehicle introduced by the automaker to date, counting only passenger cars, not delivery trucks or lorries. It is designed to primarily target families seeking a roomier and more modern electric vehicle.

Over 620 km Range and Power up to 160 kW
Regarding specifications, two equipment versions will be offered, both based on the CMF-EV electric platform using NMC batteries. The base version with a standard range of over 420 km (thanks to a 60 kWh battery) boasts a power output of 125 kW (170 horsepower)/280 Nm, accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 9.3 seconds, has a maximum speed of 150 km/h, and supports fast charging up to 130 kW.

The higher-end version will have a range of over 620 km (with an 87 kWh battery), power of 160 kW (220 horsepower)/300 Nm, 0 to 100 km/h acceleration in 8.2 seconds, a maximum speed of 170 km/h, and supports fast charging up to 150 kW. So, a charging stop should take only a few tens of minutes.

Specifications:

Dimensions: 4470 √ó 1864 √ó 1571 mm
Weight: 1,842 kg
Trunk volume: 545 liters (with rear seats folded: 777 liters)
Power: up to 160 kW
Range: over 620 km
Charging: up to 150 kW
0-100 km/h: 8.2 seconds
Maximum speed: 170 km/h
OS: Android Automotive

Price and Availability: 
The new Renault Sc√©nic E-Tech (2024) will arrive on the European market in early next year. Prices have not yet been disclosed.
